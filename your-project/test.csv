2,Eurythmics,Sisters Are Doin’ It For Themselves,Be Yourself Tonight,"Now there was a time when they used to say
That behind every - ""great man""
There had to be a - ""great woman""
But in these times of change you know
That it's no longer true
So we're coming out of the kitchen
Cause there's something we forgot to say to you (we say)
Sisters are doing it for themselves
Standing on their own two feet
And ringing on their own bells
Sisters are doing it for themselves
Now this is a song to celebrate
The conscious liberation of the female state
Mothers, daughters and their daughters too
Woman to woman
We're singing with you
The ""inferior sex"" got a new exterior
We got doctors, lawyers, politicians too
Everybody - take a look around
Can you see - can you see - can you see
There's a woman right next to you
Sisters are doing it for themselves
Standing on their own two feet
And ringing on their own bells
Sisters are doing it for themselves
Now we ain't making stories
And we ain't laying plans
Cause a man still loves a woman
And a woman still loves a man
(Just the same though)
Sisters are doing it for themselves
Standing on their own two feet
And ringing on their own bells
Sisters are doing it for themselves
Thank you, I'll get it myself",1985-10-01,https://genius.com/Eurythmics-sisters-are-doin-it-for-themselves-lyrics

Of a different kind
To take you away
And leave you far behind
And love love love
Is a dangerous drug
You have to receive it
And you still can't get enough of the stuff
It's savage and it's cruel
And it shines like destruction
Comes in like the flood
And it seems like religion
It's noble and it's brutal
It distorts and deranges
And it wrenches you up
And you're left like a zombie
And I want you
And I want you
And I want you so
It's an obsession
It's guilt edged
Glamorous and sleek by design
You know it's jealous by nature
False and unkind
It's hard and restrained
And it's totally cool
It touches and it teases
As you stumble in the debris

Oh, the missionary man, he's got God on his side
He's got the saints and apostles backing up from behind
Black eyed looks from those Bible books
He's a man with a mission, got a serious mind
There was a woman in the jungle and a monkey on a tree
The missionary man, he was following me
He said, stop what you're doing, get down upon your knees
I've a message for you that you better believe
Well I was born an original sinner
I was borne from original sin

Lying in my arms
And I was wondering where you were
You know you looked just like a baby
Fast asleep in this dangerous world
Every star was shining brightly
Just like a million years before
And we were feeling very small
Underneath the universe
And you know that I'm gonna be the one
Who'll be there when you need
Someone to depend upon

In a world of illusion

That covers up your fears
Tender is the one
That wipes away your tears

To make you sting so viciously
They say the greatest coward
Can hurt the most ferociously
But I'll show you something good
Oh, I'll show you something good
If you open your heart
You can make a new start
When your crumbling world falls apart
The miracle of love
Will take away your pain
When the miracle of love
Comes your way again

Will take away your pain (must take a miracle)

In the meadow we can build a snowman
Then pretend that he is parson brown
He'll say ""are you married?"" we'll say ""no man
But you can do the job when you're in town.""

That I'm sorry for the things I've done
But when I start to try to tell you
That's when you have to tell me
Hey...this kind of trouble's only just begun
I tell myself too many times
Why don't you ever learn to keep your big mouth shut
That's why it hurts so bad to hear the words
That keep on falling from your mouth
Falling from your mouth
Falling from your mouth
Tell me
Why
Why
I may be mad
I may be blind
I may be viciously unkind
But I can still read what you're thinking
And I've heard is said too many times
That you're better off
Besides...
Why can't you see this boat is sinking
(This boat is sinking this boat is sinking)
Let's go down to the water's edge
And we can cast away those doubts
Some things are better left unsaid
But they still turn me inside out
Turning inside out turning inside out Tell me...
Why
Tell me...
Why
This is the book I never read
These are the words I never said
This is the path I'll never tread
These are the dreams I'll dream instead
This is the joy that's seldom spread
These are the tears...
The tears we shed
This is the fear
This is the dread
These are the contents of my head
And these are the years that we have spent
And this is what they represent
And this is how I feel
Do you know how I feel?
'Cause I don't think you know how I feel
I don't think you know how I feel

And he's looking for trouble

Who knows what they'll decide to do
Who knows what they'll get up to
I'd love to know
Wouldn't you?
I love to listen to Beethoven...
You think you know just what you want
But you have used that weapon against me
Did I tell you I was lying by the way
When I said I wanted a new mink coat
I was just thinking about
Something sleek
To wrap around my tender throat
I was dreaming like a Texan girl
A girl who thinks she's got the right to everything
A girl who thinks she should have

85,Eurythmics,Anything But Strong,Peace ,"Why do you hurt yourself?
You do it very well
You do it so politely
That you couldn't even tell
When everything has changed
You think you're not to blame
How come you keep on talking
When the whole thing feels so strange?...
But seeing is not the same as believing
When everything goes wrong
You're anything but strong
It's all bittersweet
Outside in the street
The grass is growing greener
Underneath your feet
We come and go
The deep water flows
Tiny leaves from small seeds
To tall trees do grow
But wanting is not the same as needing
There's no need to pretend
You can't turn back again
And loving is so different to keeping
The hurting that we send
Is so difficult to mend
(Hold on to the good things)
(That keep you from falling down)
(Hold on the the good things)
(That keep you from falling down)
How my heart aches
More than I can take
What are we really learning
When we make the same mistakes?
Where is your hope?
It's all gone up in smoke
You used to be so funny
Now it's just the same old joke
And laughing is so very close to crying
When there's nothing to defend
It gets you in the end
And living is so very close to dying
You struggle on and on
To find where you belong
Where do you belong?",,https://genius.com/Eurythmics-anything-but-strong-lyrics

In a crazy choir

Has twisted her till the end

Right in front of you
This is what you have to do -
Get ready for revival!

You know you looked just like a baby
Fast asleep in this dangerous world
Every star was shining brightly
Just like a million years before
And we were feeling very small
Underneath the universe
And you know that I'm gonna be the one
Who'll be there when you need
Someone to depend upon
When tomorrow comes
Wait till tomorrow comes - yea yea
When tomorrow comes
Wait till tomorrow comes - yea yea

Wait till tomorrow comes - yea yea

I've Got A Lover (Back In Japan) Lyrics
I've got a lover back in Japan
He's got tatooes
He's my Superman
I try to cal him up from time to time
We can talk about the weather
Is the weather fine?
And I say break, break
Break away those ties
Break, break
I've got a lover
Up in outer space
He's been tumbling around
All over the place
I like to call him from time to time
We can talk about heaven...
Break, break
Break away those ties
Break, break...
When the whole world descends on me
I'll be waiting for you...
Got another lover in Timbuktu
Got a name for him
He's my little guru
When I don't call him he starts to cry
I have to tell him stories just to pacify
Break, break...
When the whole world descends on me
I'll be waiting for you...
I was bitter when I met you
I was eloquent with rage
Like honey from a poisoned cup
I flowed from stage to stage

You got the throne then I think I need to sit in ya chair
We could really get physical here and the sky's the limit nigga
I'll put the whole clique in the air baby
So quit playin' fore the clip spray 'em
And have his ass M.I.A. like Nick Saban
His whole shit caved in my whole clique cave men
Hardbody nigga my whole shit pavement
You can't spit if you dead in the ground
In the woods where ya head'll be found
And its good that you getting it now in the prescient confessin' it now
I can't fuck wit the rest of you clowns faggot
(Hitchcock)
I am the silence before the storm Lincoln Park to Audubon
Slang rock on the same block that the water on
I be more than gone run and get your order form
Next time I record a song gon' put my daughter on
'Cause she realla than most niggas I tote trigga
For you broke nigga and gold diggas wit no figga
That's why I palm the heater for all you non believers
I'm on ya ass like white on rice on Condoleezza
Betta con the preacher you tryna get on a feature
Betta get ya casket bastard I'm gon' eat cha
We ain't in the same weight class ya fake ass
Couldn't stop a nigga wit brake pads I'm way pass
Anything that you ever did I'm betta kid
And we never sweat a bid it's easy to get a sig
In the bing I'm like Ving Rhames I bring pain
I sling cane off the wing like I'm King James
Y'all doubtin' who when I spit the whole lead
They be callin' code read like Mountain Dew
'Fore I count to you can get cha back blown
'Cause ya gimmicks out of minutes like a track phone
Get back holmes I'm back on my shit
I don't mangle I'm like Pringles stackin my chips
Clappin' my fifth you the test me types
Comin' out wit a blade and get Wesley Sniped
So the cops could arrest me right it's not happenin'
You ain't never gon' get on so stop rappin'
H2O comin' this summer so stop askin'
All heat like wall street ya stock crashin'
Now the fed wanna read his rights
Lord have mercy Jesus Christ I got passion
I'm blackin' all my niggas getting this fetti
We in the Chevy and ready to pop tags in

So whatever you tryna do lil niggas I already done
And since you wanna live by it lil nigga then die by the gun
See whatever you tryna do lil niggas I already done
So how the fuck you gon win lil nigga when I already won
(Fabolous)
Ayo money is the root of evil I thought
But when I'm broke is when I usually have the evilest thoughts
That's when the arms come out like sleeves when it's short
Wit more bullets than ya favorite wide receiver has caught
And that Randy Mossberg ya Steve Smith and Wesson ya
The shoes pop up like instant messenger
You've got mail nah nigga you got shells
And my Mac you can't use for iChat
A guy that confused that will lie flat
And my gat is on leg like thigh tap
I that nigga who you dudes
Some broke niggas who tryna get some youtube views
Unless you wanna point blank boy ya too close
Bails in pocket this is Lawyer Lou Los
I'm pretty sure more hotties see me in that foou door roddie
Double pipes like a sawed off shotty
(Joe Budden)
I flow sickly ridin' bumpin' old biggie
Roll wit me or lose wait Nicole Richie
Fuck plat if I don?t reach diamond fame
Ill treat a nigga face like that old simon game
I figured out why men try us 'cause we o-d on rims and thin tires
For that we Len Bias
All it takes a punch he ain't brave he a punk
I'll put his family in boxes meet the Brady Bunch
How y'all feel y'all selves Shaquille y'all selves
Us cowboys don?t need you you Bill Parcell
And you ain't gotta empty ya pockets when the K's out
Whatever you holdin' is mine you my Paypal
See I don't get how this guy is a treat
I'll make his life a net por pie to the neck
Ride or die or do both nigga ride to the death
I'll acapella the whole left side of his chest
Not retiring still got that pension pendin'
Tryna pop the hood and see the engine messin'
Double barrel shotgun how ya men get missin'
She got pretty brown eyes and she in mint condition
Or the sig in the car you dissin' muah
Get the ratchet go home and just Chris Benoit
I tell a bird like it is you promise the broad
I one line her you Isaiah Thomas the broad
I can send a clip cartridge at a nemesis target
And catch a R.O.R. on some Jena six charges
Nah I put the thing away
I don't even need a whole handle to flip em all it takes is one finger wave
But in the bing for days show you how I'm real
Come home to the truck with the Optimus Prim grille
Handin' out crack got the scene poppin' off
They not sleepin' on 'em the fiends is noddin' off
For real tell me how you a thug and you Superman (Nigga)
I just seen you in the club doing the Superman (I Said Nigga!)
A bunch of clowns holmes all
I need in this world is the pound chrome Huxtable brownstone
Major paper cake by the layers
If these dudes is live I'm the created player
They callin' 'em kings when they so so hot
Somethings wrong wit that picture must be photoshopped
I don't promote violence but when sparking the flame Blam
Arms start waving like the Carlton Banks dance
When them tools go pop it move whole blocks
Come around wit cha dog or get Kujo shot
These emcee's is lame I tryta be an emcee wit brains
These niggas is M.C. Brain
Yeah nice rapper just far from bein' nice
I'm on the rooftop recordin' and niggas is bein' sniped
That's light

In the wrong place and at the wrong time
Raised palms, raised faces at me
It's not a lot, just short circuit vanity
And I know I don't show it but I'm glad you came, here

That's when you'll need me then

Their faces keep on looking
But it's all in vain

Show me your strenght
Fight the feeling
You've got to fight to the end
You keep telling me my mind is too cruel
But I can't help it if I live by these rules
You'll never change them
You'll never change them
You took me for a fool
And read my thoughts
You never realised that I couldn't be bought
I can't forget it
You will regret it
Fight the feeling
Show me your strenght
Fight the feeling
You've got to fight to the end
You can only push me so far
Before I can't take no more
I've made the vow
You've lost me now
Don't push me so far

He got married in a rush
Eight months on and summer's gone
He finds it hard to adjust
He's feeling younger now
Younger than he was before
He wishes he could change his mind
Yeah old mistakes they seem so small
And if he had to be you
Then he'd get out and do the things he's always wanted
Standing outside
Like a joker on a hill
He's drawing crazy patterns
With his shoes
Some people push by
And everyone is cursing them
But he doesn't raise his hand
He broke his dreams and lost a friend
He's asking questions now
Caught in his confusion
He shakes his head and looks at me
Then he shouts out loud
If you had to be me
Would you get out and do the things you've always wanted
Standing outside
Like a joker on a hill
He's drawing crazy patterns
With his shoes
Standing outside
Like a joker on a hill
He's drawing crazy patterns
With his shoes

And on this late night
It's getting harder now harder now

I'm gonna reach out I'm gonna grab your heart
You've been living life in the eyes of a stranger
You've gotta free your mind
Cause I want to get nearer
You're only future is promises
For so many years
You're only future is promises
I know you can make it if you try
Take the chance and make the move
But I don't think that I will approve
For once I've finally realised
Being with her wasted your life

I had to take some time

I'm always wanting you to take me there
I need to be the one to tell you that you're on the right road

In varying and different ways
Was very much in vogue
Columbine and Pantaloon
A wistful Pierrot 'neath the moon
And Harlequin, a rogue
Nowadays Parisians of leisure
Wake the echo of an old refrain
Each some ragged effigy will treasure
For his pleasure
Till the shadows of their story live again
Chorus x 1
Mournfulness has always been
The keynote of the Pierrot scene
When passion plays a part
Pierrot in a tragic pose
Will kiss a faded silver rose
With sadness in his heart
Some day soon he'll leave his tears behind him
Comedy comes laughing down the street
Columbine will fly to him
Admiring and desiring
Laying love and adoration at his feet
Parisian Pierrot
Society's hero
The Lord of a day
The Rue de la Paix
Is under your sway
The world may flatter
But what does that matter
They'll never shatter
Your gloom profound
Parisian Pierrot
Your spirit's at zero
Divinely forlorn
With exquisite scorn
From sunset to dawn
The limbo is calling
Your star will be falling
As soon as the clock goes round",,https://genius.com/Texas-parisian-pierrot-lyrics

Now it's terror
Airplanes crash into towers
Into towers, into towers

Taking our women and taking our jobs""
All reasonable thought is being drowned out
By the non-stop baying, baying, baying for blood

I was an ordinary man with ordinary desire

Danced my way across your lawn
Used a diamond on the glass
Slithered slowly through the dark
Made my way up o'er your stairs

Drive you in the boot
Through the crooked past
To your resting place

I wish we were all rose-colored too

Low-key, no pressure
Just hang with me and my weather

I want you to stop insisting that I'm not
A lost cause, 'cause I've been through a lot
Really all I've got is just to stay pissed off
If it's all right by you

But hearts are breaking, and wars are raging on
And I have taken my glasses off
You got me nervous
And you're turning it into a joke
A half empty girl
Don't make me laugh, I'll...

Leave me here a little bit longer
I think I wanna stay in the car
I don't want anybody seeing me cry now
You say ""We gotta look on the bright side""
I say ""Well, maybe if you wanna go blind""
You say my eyes are getting too dark now
But boy, you ain't ever seen my mind

Just let me cry a little bit longer
I ain't gon' smile if I don't want to
Hey, man, we all can't be like you

That we've been together
I need the other one to hold you
Make you feel, make you feel better
It's not a walk in the park
To love each other
But when our fingers interlock
Can't deny, can't deny you're worth it

Cause after all this time, I'm still into you

I should be over all the butterflies

And baby even on our worst nights
I'm into you (I'm into you)

Cause I don't really need to wonder at all
Yeah after all this time I'm still into you

Recount the night that I first met your mother
And on the drive back to my house
I told you that, I told you that I loved ya
You felt the weight of the world
Fall off your shoulder
And to your favorite song
We sang along to the start of forever

And after all this time, I'm still into you

It's a matter of time before we all run out

I waited eight long months, she finally set him free
I told him I couldn't lie, he was the only one for me
Two weeks and we caught on fire
She's got it out for me, but I wear the biggest smile

Whoa, I never meant to brag
But I got him where I want him now
Whoa, it was never my intention to brag
To steal it all away from you now
But God, does it feel so good
'Cause I got him where I want him now
And if you could, then you know you would
'Cause God, it just feels so
It just feels so good

Second chances, they don't ever matter, people never change
Once a whore you're nothing more
I'm sorry, that'll never change
And about forgiveness, we're both supposed to have exchanged
I'm sorry honey, but I passed it up, now look this way
Well, there's a million other girls who do it just like you
Looking as innocent as possible to get to who
They want and what they like
It's easy if you do it right
Well I refuse, I refuse, I refuse!

Whoa, I never meant to brag
But I got him where I want him now
Whoa, it was never my intention to brag
To steal it all away from you now
But God, does it feel so good
'Cause I got him where I want him right now
And if you could, then you know you would
'Cause God, it just feels so
It just feels so good

I watched his wildest dreams come true
And not one of them involving you
Just watch my wildest dreams come true
Not one of them involving

Whoa, I never meant to brag
But I got him where I want him now

Whoa, I never meant to brag
But I got him where I want him now

And curse at the wind
He broke his own heart and I watched
As he tried to reassemble it

Never let herself forget
And that was the day that I promised
I'd never sing of love if it does not exist

But, darling
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception

Maybe I know, somewhere
Deep in my soul, that love never lasts
And we've got to find other ways
To make it alone, but keep a straight face
And I've always lived like this
Keeping a comfortable distance
And up until now, I had sworn to myself
That I'm content with loneliness
Because none of it was ever worth the risk

Well, you are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception

I've got a tight grip on reality
But I can't, let go of what's in front of me here
I know you're leaving in the morning, when you wake up
Leave me with some kind of proof it's not a dream

Could've gotten the same rush from any lover's touch

'Cause no one breaks my heart like you

When you kiss me, I wish we could see what happens next
For a moment, I could forget what happens in my head
If I doubt you, would you come through?
Happy second chance or happy ending
But this time you don't leave me sinking

(I'm underwater) No air in my lungs
(My eyes are open) And I'm giving up
(You are the wave) I could never tame
If I survive, I'll dive back in

As if the first blood didn't thrill enough
I went further out to see what else was left of us
Never found the deep end of our little ocean
Drain the fantasy of you
Headfirst into shallow pools

And I wonder, is it better to get it over with?
The illusion, can shatter before we begin
If you're really sorry
Happy second chance, think I could forgive
This time you won't leave me sinking

I felt it was leading to a continued
 I hope this is helpful for you. 
When I wrote this letter I felt I may have been finally able to address how it feels

Another brick-red room, another black-top town
Another misspelled band burning their own houses down
Another pine-box tune to fill the cemetery day
Another star, a touch of orange over purgatory gray
Another thorny field to scatter fruitless seed
Another song that runs too long, God knows no one needs
More misguided ghosts, more transparent hands
To drop a nickel in our basket and we'll do our riot! dance
Beneath another burning sky, behind our painted lips
In scores of catatonic smile-covered ankle-bitten ships
So throw your pedestal of stone in the forgetful sea
As protection from the paper-thin perfection you project on me
When this repetition ends behind the window shades
A semi-conscious sorrow sleeping in the bed I've made
That most unrestful bed, that most original of sins
And you'll say that's what I get when I let ambitions win again
I'd hate to let you down so I'll let the waters rise
And drown my dull reflection in the naive expectation in your eyes
Back in a cast bit-part, back when I felt most free
I had a butcher's heart and no one thought they knew me
So before the regiment resumes, before the dreaded sun appears
My driver's waiting, so let's make one point crystal clear:
You see a flood-lit form, I see a shirt design
I'm no savior of yours and you're no friend of mine
You're no friend of mine
You're no friend of mine
I'm no savior of yours and you're no friend of mine
You see a flood-lit form
I see a shirt design
I'm no savior of yours and you're no friend of mine

I see myself in the reflection of people's eyes
Realising that what they see may not be even close to the image I see in myself
And I hate I might actually be more afraid
 I feel like they know the story
I saw a bear floating in the river and thought it was a fur coat
Twelve years ago I stood on the shore
Jump in and grab the coat
And the river is rushing toward a waterfall
And my friend stood at the shore and shouted to let go of the coat and swim back to land
I let go of the coat but the coat won't let go of me
In any case please let me know if there's more I can give you
If nothing comes of it, then just know we are grateful",2017-05-12,https://genius.com/Paramore-no-friend-lyrics

Shot a hole in the sun

Coiled up on the dirty ground
Her prince finally came to save her

And the clock struck twelve
Well, make sure to build your house brick by boring brick
Or the wolf's gonna blow it down

Keep your feet on the ground

Go get your shovel

Because your real life is tragic
Yeah, you built up a world of magic

If it's not real
You can't hold it in your hand
You can't feel it with your heart

But if it's true
Then you can see it with your eyes

Expecting perfect scripted movie scenes
Who wants an awkward silent mystery?

And run from them, from them

We'll run from them, from them

Don't need no roads

And pain is just a simple compromise
So we can get what we want out of it
Would someone care to classify
Our broken hearts and twisted minds
So I can find someone to rely on

And run to them, to them

We are just

Misguided ghosts

The ones we trusted the most
Pushed us far away
And there's no one road
And we should not be the same

What a mess, what a mystery we've made
Of love and other simple things
Learning to forgive even when it wasn't a mistake
I question every human who won't look in my eyes
Scars left on my heart formed patterns in my mind

Oh glory

Hiding beneath it all and
Growing beneath it all and

To people who aren't kind
And heroes who are blind
Expecting perfect scripted movie scenes
Who wants an awkward silent mystery?

I hate to see your eyes get darker as they close

For all the joy that is to come
For all the things that you're alive to feel
Just let the pain remind you hearts can heal

So you invade my sleep and confuse my dreams
Turn my nights to sleepless itch

Stuck on you 'till the end of time

Holding on the telephone
I hear your mid range moan
You're everywhere inside my room
Even when I'm alone I hear your mellow drone
You're everywhere inside of me

Stuck on you 'till the end of time
I'm too tired to fight your rhyme
Stuck on you 'till the end of time

I can't escape your incessant whine
When you beam it out all across the sky
No I can't escape

96,Paramore,Paramore Exit Statement,---,"Hey guys,
Let me start by apologizing to you for the way everything went down on Saturday.  I had a statement typed ready to post to you guys but Hayley released one without my permission.  We were not going to issue a statement until we worked out our exit agreement with Hayley.  I wish it didn’t have to happen that way, Zac and I wanted to be the ones you heard it from.  I want to be honest with you guys about how this band formulated from day one. I did not think Hayley’s version told the whole story, at least from our perspective and hopefully this will explain a bit about why we are leaving.
Zac and I had a garage band in high school with the intentions of just making music for the love of it. We met Taylor and our friend Jason Clark at our school and found out that we shared the same musical tastes.  So, we asked them to join our band. It was some of the greatest times of our lives playing music in Taylor’s basement with them.  We obviously needed a lead singer and one day Zac met Hayley.  We asked her to come try out and eventually to join the band.
Months down the road things changed and this band became all about Hayley.  She had a manager at the time that controlled her every move along with her parents.  They didn’t like the idea of Hayley being in a rock band so they forced her to leave wanting her to pursue a solo career.
Hayley went off to write and record her solo demos while the four of us continued on without her.  A couple of months later Hayley came and asked us if she could use the song “Conspiracy” that we had all previously written together.  We agreed that that would be fine.  I got a call a while after that from Hayley telling me that her manager said that Zac and I were invited to be back in the band (the band we started), but not Taylor and Jason because they weren’t good enough in his eyes. Hayley brought in Jeremy and our first rhythm guitarist Jason Bynum as the other two members.
We travelled to LA a few weeks later for a showcase and it was a nightmare.  Hayley’s manager would tell the band to be in the lobby of the hotel at a certain time, but he and Hayley wouldn’t show for hours.  We found out that they had been meeting with record label executives all morning without us, which is totally weird given that this wasn’t simply a solo artist, but we were a band. The band was in the dark the whole time.  After many meetings between Hayley, her manager and the labels they decided to sign her to Atlantic records. We didn’t understand why Hayley was the only one signing the contract since we were told this was a “band”, but we were too young to grasp all of this.  So far, Zac and I haven’t signed with another label, although I guess our part of Paramore sure could. Next thing we knew we were having a signing party for Hayley.
Our next move was to rerecord her solo demos with our own music rather than studio musicians to make it sound more genuine. Meanwhile, we tossed around band names. I wrote out a list of names, including “Paramore”, a name my old band with Taylor and Jason Clark had thought about using. Obviously, we settled on that name. The label received the rerecorded demos and once again tried to fire the entire band, saying we were terrible. Thankfully Hayley and I had been writing some new songs together (Hallelujah, Here We Go Again) that the label was pleased with so that acted as leverage for the band to stay. The label and management then decided to build our band up the grass-roots route. They put Hayley on Fueled by Ramen not making it known she was signed to Atlantic as well. All the while we still questioned whether or not we were an actual band, but Hayley continued to insist we were, despite our being ignored and pushed around by the label.
They then sent us all to Orlando to rehearse and write eight hours a day for our first record. Half -way though this process, Jeremy decided to quit.  We were all really upset about it. So we finished the record, replaced Jeremy, and hit the road with Hayley’s father as our tour manager/driver of a twelve-passenger van. Her dad would constantly threaten to “pull the plug” on the whole band if we complained about anything, suggesting that we were hired guns and Hayley was the real artist, when in reality we were also part of the band. We’ve always been treated as less important than Hayley. It’s been obvious how her family views things.
Jeremy ended up rejoining and we toured non-stop for two and half years building our fan base, pretending to be a band that started naturally. In reality, what started as natural somehow morphed into a manufactured product of a major label, riding on the coattails of “Hayley’s dream.”
Before recording our next record, we kicked out Jeremy for his lack of work ethic and participation in things that Zac, Hayley and I didn’t agree with.  At this point it was just the three of us to record Riot. Once the record was done, we needed a bassist and another guitarist. Eventually Zac and I convinced Hayley to let Taylor rejoin and she convinced us to let Jeremy back in, promising he had changed his ways.
Once again we hit the road and toured on our biggest record as a band. As you all know Hayley and I dated and broke up during this album cycle. Things then started going downhill for our band. Hayley and Jeremy’s views started changing from what we all once believed in. The band almost split after cancelling a tour in Europe, but we managed to keep it together somehow. This is when Zac and I started to consider quitting the band.
Once we finished touring on Riot, we came home for a break and started writing for Brand New Eyes. Hayley presented lyrics to us that were really negative and we didn’t agree with. For example, “the truth never set me free”, which contradicts what the Bible says in John 8:32 (“and you shall know the truth, and the truth shall sat you free”). We fought her about how her lyrics misrepresented our band and what we stood for, but in the end she got her way. Instead of fighting her any longer, we decided to just roll over and let it go.
Hayley claimed that this record reunited us as band and made us grow closer together, when in reality we were all growing further apart. Suddenly the band had spilt into two sides. Touring became more difficult since we couldn’t agree on anything. The friendships our band once had were no longer existent. Amos 3:3 says, “Can two people walk together without agreeing on the direction”.  In addition to the band turmoil, touring had really taken its toll on us both. We left home at such a young age and missed taking part in normal teenage years.  When you own part of a band and are constantly playing, you make sacrifices.  Touring has taken its toll on our family members as well. I specifically remember many moments where our parents would break down in tears when we had to leave. It broke my heart. Seeing our siblings grow up so much during our absences was never easy either.
After a lot a prayer and counsel Zac and I came to the decision that it was time to leave the band. We truly feel that God is leading us elsewhere and is going to do great things with us. The intention of this statement was not to belittle or disgrace the rest of the band, it was simply to clarify our decision for leaving and our desire to finally tell you guys the truth.  We are still hoping to work out a friendly way to leave our part of Paramore intact with the remaining band members, including Hayley.
We want to thank you guys for all of your love and support over the past 7 years. It’s been an honor creating and playing music for you. If music is what God calls us to in the future, we hope that you all will be a part of it.
All of the glory be to God,
Josh and Zac",2010-12-21,https://genius.com/Paramore-paramore-exit-statement-annotated

1,Sleigh Bells,I Can Only Stare,Jessica Rabbit,"I can only stare into the field for so long
I can only stare into the field for so long

Watching you from the chair
Dragging a brush through your hair
You're just right over there
You know I'm grieving, giving off heat, oh
Cross my heart, hope to die
You and I, you and I
Why aren't we sharing the breath
Till there's nothing left but carbon dioxide
Why won't you let me come over
And do what you want me to? Ooh

I can only stare, I can only stare
(You see, it's pulling my heart down, it's pulling my heart down)
I can only stare, I can only stare
(You see, it's pulling my heart down, it's pulling my heart down)
I'd like to go back there but I can
I can only stare, I can only
I'd like to go back there but I can
I can only stare, I can only

Do you know how I feel knocking on your door
Till my knuckles bleed?
I can't perform miracles, it's dedication time, oh oh oh

I can only stare, I can only stare
(You see, it's pulling my heart down, it's pulling my heart down)
I can only stare, I can only stare

Steppin' on throats, clippin' the knees

Goin' down so rapidly
Free of wreckage
Down below licking streets
I believe deeply in decency (indecency)
And when I'm conscious, I am cursed
Shark teeth the size of pickup trucks

And when you die
I wanna die, I wanna die with you
And lay us down for good
And lay us down for good

Still torn down by a symphony
I need something warm
Like jet blast
Cool breeze, cool G
I'm having a hard time
Remembering what's important to me
A lifetime just waiting around
For moments like these

For moments like these

I got the Kool-aid
I hear the kick drum
Talking to my baby
I wanna feel the ocean
Put on my suntan lotion
I see the sun glow
Water moving slow motion
I got a beach chair
I see the blonde hair
Kick up my feet there
I feel the cool air
The breeze is nice now
I'll tell you right now
I sip my Kool-aid
I'm feeling better now

Do I need a vacation?
Just need to get away for a while
Wait, did I forget my sunglasses?
Nope
Got 'em!

I paint my nails pink
They're in the sand though
I hear the old soul
Coming out my radio
I see a young boy
Hanging on a ropeswing
He gets a nosebleed
And I hear the gull sing
I hope the water's warm
Gotta get my swims on
I pull my straps up
I'll see a thunderstorm
Oh no no no no no no no no
No no no no no no no no no
No no no no no no no no no

Talking about boys
Put the music on
I'll just start dancing

Good looking sea shells
Need to make some new wishes
Watch out for sea glass
Watch out for jellyfishes
I see a young boy
Swimming out to sea now
I tell the life guard
He can't be bothered now
It's getting late though
Clouds are getting real low
The breeze is nice yes
I think I better go
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

They just sat right outside
And started looking at me
Everything was just perfect

Ripping down stars while I stand on my toes

Two Tornadoes touch down in Kansas
Instinct takes over, instinct commands us
Stare at the moon in a memory lapse
Wind up the clock, total collapse

Pop rocks and coke make your head explode

From the field I can see you in the stands
Drinking lemonade, spinning like a ceiling fan
So haunting, so confusing
Ice cream is goose, Linus and Lucy

Are you doubting yourself?
Are you proud of yourself?
You lost it, bought a rifle, took it home
Put it in the corner of your closet
But it's not on your mind yet, oh no
No, it's not on your mind yet
I'm gonna stand on my toes ripping stars down
There will be no end to my rainmaking

I'm borderline, so you noticed
With every move that you make
I'm well aware of your methods
You are distant and cold
The excess of rapture that shatters me
Attraction, destructive
A permanent embrace of oblivion

Bombs don't compare to the trouble you bring me
I just can't stand you anymore
You're killing me, but I'm killing me too
I just can't stand you anymore
I just can't stand you...

Confession: I'm manic and breathless
It's exhausting, I'm digressing
Sometimes I cease to exist
So why even bother?
Who died and made you boss?
'Cause there's no one there, the stakes are so high
Attraction, destructive
Why do you do this to me?

Bombs don't compare to the trouble you bring me
I just can't stand you anymore
You're killing me, but I'm killing me too

Bombs don't compare to the trouble you bring me

I said it wrong, I fucked it all up
But you know what I mean
Yeah, you know what I mean
Came out all wrong
Sometimes, we come out all wrong
'Cause I was blind half of the time
Paralyzed, the fault is all mine

Bombs don't compare to the trouble you bring me

You're killing me, but I'm killing me too

The cleanest war was won before

Say that you love and you'll never know
Never gonna know if you ever go because

Chaos come
I used to drink gasoline in the morning
In the middle of the day on the trampoline
Summertime dreams, Billie Jean
Blood stains on blue jeans
And the downpours came like a freight train
Filled swimming pools with acid rain
Raise hell, damage, drink
Took this spin on things
I’ll do it, I’ll jump
Not for kicks, not for fun
But because this shit is too much
It’s fucking me up
Enough is enough
Enough is enough
Evidence of moral detours
In the downtown holy wars
Hysterical depths of casual hatred
Taking place in everyday places
Laughing hysterically
At the comedies and the tragedies
White trash, blue flame
Blue trash, red rage
I’ll do it, I’ll jump
Just for kicks, just for fun
‘Cause goddamn, this shit is too much
It’s fucking me up
Enough is enough
Enough is enough
I used to drink gasoline in the morning
They want us to jump
Just for kicks, just for fun
Just to watch

It’s fucking us up

I'm kicking up dirt, pulling down trees one by one

They can't figure out why everyone hates us
When I'm light, alright, I'll defend everyone, every friend

Who you gonna blame this on

When the birds start bleeding now
And it's all the same, it's all the same

With the mirror crashing down
And you stood so tall
But you fall and you're never gonna get back up

Take a look at yourself
But don't punish me for tellin' the truth
You're above it, or anyway, it's above you
You try to stay low, low to the ground
But you keep hitting your head on the sun
Which isn't gettin' any younger
I know it's coming, but I don't know where from, oh

And you might be a champion
Of unrestricted beauty
But so often, you fail (You fail)
And that's nothing to be ashamed of
Remember what you said?
What you were so afraid of?
You're grinding inside, in pain
But the sparks are bright

You started to run, you started splitting atoms for fun
You fought in hundreds of wars
You got married, got a divorce
Set your bed on fire, and slept on the floor
You're manic and breathless
Humble, a tyrant, prophetic
All in once sentence, I know
And such is your power, I stand
I stand, humble, before you

And you might be a champion
Of unrestricted beauty
But so often, you fail (You fail)
And that's nothing to be ashamed of
Remember what you said?
What you were so afraid of?
You're grinding inside, in pain

I'm in your face now, what's wrong?

You were out of your depth, out of your depth

You wan't a real fight tonight?
You're still living in your own world
The road isn't long, but it's winding
The future isn't bright, it's blinding
But a star is a medal on display
Always earned the hard way
And other lies and other rhymes
Where'd I put my keys?
Where'd I put my keys?

Suckled on the honey of the Tennessee
Where we would sleep in the soft sunshine
I smile at you and you to me
And in the dark, I see the moon
Shine in your eyes
We grew strong and tall as weeds
Never live forever, there were no such thing
I looked at you, and you looked into me
And we saw in each other, everything
We knew no fear, as we grew the years
That's the growing up
We've come to love
On this planet not so far away
We wouldn't stay together
Rolling in a dream
We'd drift apart, on down the stream
Like honeysuckle tangled up in kudzu vine
The snake that lay in the sun, so fine
I saw true you, and you, true me
And in your eyes
I'd see the dark inside of you
Woke from dream
Pulled up like weed
Never knew no better, there were no such thing

Runaway and you'll be found

Yeah, its for always
If I'm gonna love you wit all of my heart
And if there is no more time
This always remains
Even as the world spins itself apart...
Cuz i remember them days i waited so patiently
For god to bring someone who's gonna be good to me
And then he blessed my soul
Well, i traveled a long way
And it took a long time to find you...
But i finally found you...
I remember all them lonely days
I traveled out on my own
Then you brought me everything
Ya made my house a home
If its not the real deal then i dont know it
Cuz it show does feel, and i think it sho does show
I remember all them days i waited so patiently
Until god brought someone who's gonna be good to me
And he blessed my soul...

On your way to heaven, did you say I'll see you again
It wasn't me, why wasn't it was me?
On your way to to the promised land, did you say
""Oh, She was such a friend?""
Then they took you higher and
I don't know If I can follow...
It wasn't me, why wasn't it was me?

I guess it's not that bad

For your touch, your kisses and your sweet romancin'
There’s another side of you, weh this a woman yah adore
Aside from your temper, everything else secure
You’re good for me, baby, for that, I’m sure
'Cause over and over again, me want more

You've used up all your coupons
And all you got left is me
And somehow I'm full of forgiveness

That was the girl I used to be
You had me on my knees
I'd trade you places any day
I'd never thought you could be that way

You came in with the breeze

You sure have changed since yesterday
Without any warning
I thought I knew you
I thought I knew you
I thought I knew you well, so well

You're trying my shoes on for a change
They look so good but fit so strange
Out of fashion so I can complain

You came in with the breeze

You sure have changed since yesterday
Without any warning
I thought I knew you
I thought I knew you
I thought I knew you well, so well

I know who I am, but who are you
You're not looking like you used to
You're on the other side of the mirror
So nothing's looking quite as clear
Thank you, for turning on the light
Thank you, now you're the parasite
I didn't think you had it in you
And now, you're looking like I used to

""Hey baby, hey baby, hey!""
Hey baby, baby..

I’m the kinda girl that hangs with the guys
Like a fly on the wall with my secret eyes
Taking it in, try to be feminine
With my makeup bag watching all the sin
Misfit, I sit
Lit up, wicked
Everybody else surrounded by the girls
With the tank tops and the flirty words (hey baby)

I’m just sippin' on chamomile
Watching boys and girls and their sex appeal
With a stranger in the face who says he knows my mom
And went to my high school

All the boys say:
""Hey baby, hey baby, hey!""
Girls say, girls say:
""Hey baby, hey baby, hey!""
Hey baby, baby.. (hey baby)

I’m the one they feed upon
Give a bit a star is born
And if you're hot enough you'll get the pass
So you can tell your friends how you made it back

No matter what they say I’m still the same
Somehow everybody knows my name
And all the girls wanna get with the boys
And the boys really like it

The precious collection you've housed in your covers
My simpleness threatened by my own admission
And the bags are much too heavy
In my insecure condition
My pregnant mind is fat full with envy again

But I still love to wash in your old bathwater
Love to think that you couldn't love another
I can't help it...you're my kind of man

Wanted and adored by attractive women
Bountiful selection at your discretion
I know I'm diving into my own destruction
So why do we choose the boys that are naughty?
I don't fit in so why do you want me?
And I know I can't tame you...but I just keep trying

Cause I love to wash in your old bathwater
Love to think that you couldn't love another
I'm on your list with all your other women
But I still love to wash in your old bathwater
You make me feel like I couldn't love another
I can't help it...you're my kind of man
Why do the good girls always want the bad boys?

So I pacify problems with kisses and cuddles
Diligently doubtful through all kinds of trouble
Then I find myself choking on all my contradictions

Cause I still love to wash in your old bathwater
Love to think that you couldn't love another
Share a toothbrush...you're my kind of man
I still love to wash in your old bathwater
Make me feel like I couldn't love another
I can't help it...you're my kind of man

A simple kind of life
And all I needed was a simple man
So I could be a wife
I'm so ashamed, I've been so mean
I don't know how it got to this point
I always was the one with all the love
You came along, I'm hunting you down
Like a sick domestic abuser looking for a fight
And all I wanted was the simple things
A simple kind of life
If we met tomorrow for the very first time
Would it start all over again?
Would I try to make you mine?
I always thought I'd be a mom
Sometimes I wish for a mistake
The longer that I wait the more selfish that I get
You seem like you'd be a good dad
Now all those simple things
Are simply too complicated for my life
How'd I get so faithful to my freedom?

12,No Doubt,Tragic Kingdom,Tragic Kingdom,"""Remain seated, please. Permanecer sentados, por favor""

Once was a magical place, over time it was lost
Price increased the cost
Now the fortune of the kingdom
Is locked up in its dungeon vaults
The castle floor lies in traps with coiled wires set back
Decoyed by old cheese
Now the drawbridge has been lifted
As the millions, they drop to their knees

They pay homage to a king
Whose dreams are buried in their minds
His tears are frozen stiff
Icicles drip from his eyes

The cold wind blows as it snows on those who fight to get in
On heads that are small
Disillusioned as they enter
They're unaware what's behind castle walls
But now it's written in stone, the king has been overthrown
By jesterly fools
And the power of the people
Shall come to believe they do rule

They pay homage to a king
Whose dreams are buried in their minds
His tears are frozen stiff
Icicles drip from his eyes
Welcome to the tragic kingdom
Cornfields of popcorn have yet to spring open

Have they lost their heads, or are they just all blind mice?
We've heard all their stories one too many times
Hypnotized by fireflies that glow in the dark
Midgets that disguise themselves as tiny little dwarfs
The parade that's electrical
It serves no real purpose
Just takes up a lot of juice

They pay homage to a king
Whose dreams are buried in their minds
His tears are frozen stiff
Icicles drip from his eyes

Ooh, they drip from his eyes into the night
They drip from his eyes
They pay homage to a king
A king who's buried, buried in their minds
They drip from his eyes

13,No Doubt,Excuse Me Mr.,Tragic Kingdom,"I'm like a beggar with no luck
I'm holding signs up
On your street corner stops
Like most you try not to see me
You stare straight ahead
Ignore the responsibility

Excuse me (Excuse me Mr)
I've been waiting in line
And I'd like to buy some of your time
I'm very anxious, eager, willing
What's your billing?

So please excuse me Mr
You've got things all wrong
You make it feel like a crime
So don't confuse me Mr
I've known you too long
All I need is a little of your time

For most love comes for free
They don't pay the high cost
Of mental custody I'll pay bail for a guarantee
Make space for me In the time yet to be

Excuse me (Excuse me Mr)
I've been waiting in line
And I'd like to buy
Some of your time
I've been saving up my life
What's your price?

So please excuse me Mr
You've got things all wrong
You make it feel like a crime
So don't confuse me Mr
I've known you too long
All I need is a little of your time

What should I do?
I'm about to crack
And there's a force
That comes over me
It's almost as if I'm tied to the tracks
And I'm waiting for him
To rescue me
The funny thing is
He's not going to come
He's not going to find me
This is a matter of fact
The desire you lack
This is the way I guess it has to be
A little of your time
I need a little of your time
Please, a little of your time

So please excuse me Mr
You've got things all wrong
You make it feel like a crime
So don't confuse me Mr
I've known you too long
All I need is a little of your time

14,No Doubt,Oi to the World,"Everything In Time (B-Sides, Rarities, Remixes)","Haji was a punk just like any other boy
And he never had no trouble till he started up his Oi band
Safe in the garage or singing in the tub
Until Haji went too far and he plugged in at the pub
It was a cold Christmas eve when Trevor and the skins
Popped in for a pint and to nick a back of crisps
Trevor liked the music but not the Unity
He unwound Haji's turban and he knocked him to his knees

If God came down on Christmas Day
I know exactly what He'd say
He'd say ""Oi to the punks and Oi to the skins-
But Oi to the world and everybody wins!""

Haji was a bloody mess, he ran out through the crowd
He said ""we'll meet again we are bloody but not unbowed""
Trevor called his bluff and told him where to meet
Christmas day on the roof down at 20 Oxford street


On the roof with the nun chucks Trevor broke a lot of bones
But Haji had a sword like that guy in Indiana Jones
Police sirens wailing, a bloody dying man
Haji was alone and abandoned by his band
Trevor was there fading and still so full of hate
When the skins left him there and went down the fire escape
Oi! Oi!
But then Haji saw the north star shining more then ever
So he made a tourniquet from his turban saving Trevor
They repelled down the roof with the rest of the turban
And went back to the pub where they bought each other bourbon

If God came down on Christmas Day
I know exactly what He'd say
He'd say ""Oi to the punks and Oi to the skins
But Oi to the world and everybody wins!
If God came down on Christmas Day
I know exactly what He'd say
He'd say ""Oi to the punks and Oi to the skins
But Oi to the world and everybody wins!

And you’re consuming me violently
And your reverence shamelessly tempting me

I’ll be back in line with my broken heart

18,No Doubt,Different People,Tragic Kingdom,"Things can be broken down
In this world of ours
You don't have to be a famous person
Just to make your mark
A mother can be an inspiration
To her little son
Change his thoughts, his mind, his life
Just with her gentle hum
So different, yet so the same
Two sisters only have their parents to blame
It's rare that two can get along
But when they do, they're inseparable
Such a blessing comes to few

The sky is full of clouds and
My world's full of people
You got the different kinds with different ways
It would take a lifetime to explain
Not one's the same

He and she, two different people
With two separate lives
Then you put the two together
And get a spectacular surprise
Cause one can teach the other one
What she doesn't know
While still the other fills a place inside
He never knew had room to grow
Grow grow

The sky is full of clouds and
My world's full of people
You got the different kinds with different ways
It would take a lifetime to explain
Not one's the same

Once in a while I sit back
And think about the planet
And most of the time I trip on it
To kick back and think about
How massive it all is
And how many others are on it

I often think about the world
In which I live today, of animals and plants
And nature's gifts set on display
But the most amazing thing
That I've seen in my time
Are all the different people
And all their different minds
Minds minds minds
And different ways
It would take a lifetime to explain
Not one's exactly the same
So many different people
So many different kinds
So many, many, many different people
So many different

Look at me, I'm a person
Look at me, I'm my own person
So many different people
So many different kinds
For better or for worse, different people",1995-10-10,https://genius.com/No-doubt-different-people-lyrics

But you gave her up
Cause dependency might interrupt

There's no looking back
And this time I mean it

Are you happy now?
Oh tell me how?
Are you happy now?
Are you happy?

The uncertainty you had of me
Brought cloudy shady company
The tenderness habitual
A seldom-fading ritual
You killed the pair
Now only one is breathing

I won't be there, no more bother
If you feel you just might want me
That's too bad, I'm not that easy

Now you must adhere
To your new career of liberation
You've been cast all by yourself
You're free at last

With a dolphin smile
With no elbow room
With your body in bloom

Protected by big walls

Cause you've been too small

And you're feeling old
But they won't believe
That you've got a soul
No whoa oh no
Cause you're only sixteen
And you're feeling real
But you can't seem to cop a feel

Why do they have to force us
Through this metamorphosis?
Little butterfly
No matter how you try
You'll be segregated
You're gonna be closed off
You're callow and you're green
Cause you're caught between

You're only sixteen
Try to cross the line
But your little wings are intertwined
No whoa oh no
You're only sixteen
And you're such a tease
And there's nothing you do
That can really please
No whoa oh no

Just products of rough neighborhoods and bad housing situations)

You know you can forsake it
So sit back and take it
You see you're not just ripe
So don't try and fight

That you're only sixteen
You wanna catch a peek
But they look at you
Like you're such a freak
No whoa oh no
Well, you're only sixteen
With a lot to say
But they, they won't give you

Every step must be placed so that I don't fall off
Looking down to see about how much higher I am
Another cool wind comes through, brushes my skin
The harder I push, the tension does grow
I gather my thoughts the further and further I go
With some luck I just might keep on climbing
So better to climb than to face a fall

So high the climb
I can't turn back now
Must keep on climbing up to the clouds
So high the climb
I can't turn back now
Must keep on climbing up to the clouds

Pulling myself up by a rope
I better my view
The only thing in sight is what I must do
As I turned I could see myself falling
Which in return gave me strength for the climb

So high the climb
I can't turn back now
Must keep on climbing up to the clouds
So high the climb
I can't turn back now
Must keep on climbing up to the clouds

Although many failed, I must now prevail with no question
Have no time to stop, onward to the top of the mountain
And I can't turn back now
It's so very high but I can't turn back now
If I keep it up, I'm gonna make it
I'm so very close, can't you see?

So high the climb
I can't turn back now
Must keep on climbing up to the clouds

But we’re too human to see the way we’ll agonize

A real love survives
A rock steady vibe
A real love survives
A rock steady vibe

Steady now stop rocking it
It’s a delicate environment
Retired but sleeping is our shanty love
Be careful now, don’t wake it up

It’s never gonna make it back alive

Crumbling continuity, I pick up the pieces

Fear from being neutered

Quickly I'm altered and tempted by new love only rented

So I can sparkle and be the envy of my friends
I'd proudly hold the leash that I'd have you on
So you can't stray and follow me around all day

I don't think it can fade
It's too real now
Fulfillment just adds fuel to the blaze
Compulsion has stained me
I'm nervously cradling our young love
Without known limits love
Like a butterfly cupped in my hands
I peek in to see beauty trapped
Confined it flutters
Then it leaves behind colorful dust
To remind me of the special times we've spent
But of course it has to leave my clutch
But enough's never enough to make a dent

It's too late now
I don't think it can fade

I'm sorry you've had some scary days
I'm lucky, they had me on a leash
Exposing, sometimes you frighten me

And it's too bad you're so sad
I wish you could have had what I had

I'm loathing most of your history
Hesitation, but then you siphon me
Your potential, well I'll indulge in that
Violent timing explains the aftermath

And it's too bad you're so sad
I wish you could have had what I had
And it's so sad it's too bad
Maybe I can make you feel better
Oh maybe I'm supposed to make you feel better

I want to comfort you
I want to comfort you
I want to comfort you

Unlike you I had it easy
You're dark blue
Stained from previous days

And you're so sad

I wish you could have had what I had
And it's too bad you're so sad
Maybe I can make you feel better

But I want to be myself
A counterfeit disposition
Can't be good for my health
So many different faces
Depending on the different phases
My personality changes
I'm a chameleon
There's more than one dimension
I can fool you and attract attention
Camouflage my nature
Let me demonstrate…

Makeup's all off
Who am I?
Magic's in the make up
Who am I?

If you bore me then I'm comfortable
If you interest me I'm scared
My attraction paralyzes me
No courage to show my true colors that exist
But I want to be the real thing
But if you catch my eye can't be authentic
The one's I loath are the one's that know me the best

Makeup's all off
Who am I?
Magic's in the make up
Who am I?

The makeup's all off

I’m looking at a picture of your face
The last time I looked, you were looking really good
But somehow pictures fade

And we’re on the phone, we’re all alone
And that just ain’t good enough
I go around the world to see your face
'Cause this just ain’t good enough

So I’m just kickin' it, I’m counting the days
I hardly can wait, for us to hang out
I’m really missing it in so many ways
I anticipate us making out

Sip my morning tea but you’re not next to me
Here goes another day
And driving in my car, I wonder how you are
While our favorite music plays

The flowers arrive to my surprise
But that just ain’t good enough
And I got the note, it gave me hope
But that just ain’t good enough

Long distance, don’t talk about

Is just taking the piss

To send me in real deep

Alter nature for the pleasure
Orthocycline
Flirt with conception
Slow the cycle
Will the baby grow?

All the unknown chemicals
Control the cycle

From dust to dust
Burying my grandma

Change at Victoria)

And you're a vacant chair
A chosen compromise
This space we rarely share
And if you lived here you'd be home now
So what you givin' up for me?
And what shall I give up for you?
Aimless expectations passing by

If you lived here you'd be home now
If you lived here you'd be home now

And to make it real
I need to have you here
I need to have you
I need to hold you

Barren wasted heart
Neglect of normalcy

And if you lived here you'd be home now
Oh if you lived here you'd be home now

And to make it real
I need to have you here
I need to have you

Unless you spend time here
I need to see you

Supervision is what I need
Some consistence, tangibility
Some casual light days
Part of the furniture
I want to take you for granted
And see you regular
So what you givin' up for me?
And what shall I give up for you?
The separations tired, it's been too long

Not so important to the plot

Leaving life in-between
Destroyed and overwrought

Red-handed in the act

Does not want to shine on me
And sometimes I find myself blind
At first I cannot see and then I see it's me
I chose a road when I was young
In search of fun temptation won
And all my soul I did surrender
If I had a chance to go back now
Would I redeem my moral vows
Or would I repeat for my own laughter
Sometimes I hide somewhat
Like a bulb behind a shade
And sometimes I ask myself why
Is it cause the lights are too bright
Or because my eyes are closed too tight

Sometimes I find myself blind
Don't use my brain don't use my mind
Distorted feelings always leading my way
But I must forgive myself and let the past lay
Down to rest
And I'll be prepared to face myself in another
Day - hey

From now on I will behave
But in the back of my mind I will be enslaved
From now on I will behave
But in the back of my mind I will be enslaved

Does not want to shine on me
And sometimes, sometimes
I get lost, I get lost

In search of fun temptation won

Would I redeem my moral vows
Or would I repeat for my own laughter

Rock the city with the number one sound
Long beat, long beach and it feels so fine
Rock this shit straight back to Anaheim

Pick up those building blocks
Chop off the baby's locks
Swing dolly by the hair
Put down that teddy bear
Slam dunk the happy clown
I throw my toys around
I've got no time for bedtime stories
I'm not a little child
Everything makes me furious
And everything makes me wild
If you were frightened then whistle
And I come running to you
As you boo hoo

Don't let me out of your sight
I'm just a girl, all pretty and petite
So don't let me have any rights

So many reasons for me to run and hide
I can't do the little things I hold so dear
Cause it's all those little things
That I fear

Cause I'm just a girl, I'd rather not be
Cause they won't let me drive
Late at night I'm just a girl
Guess I'm some kind of freak
Cause they all sit and stare with their eyes

I'm just a girl
Take a good look at me

Oh, am I making myself clear

I'm just a girl in the world

Experimental expression downward looks
You come sniff around, I'm not sure what to do
But like a big explosion, magically
Look at me I think I might have found a new friend

You've been inside too long now, I must clean the mess

Go take yourself for a walk, you make me sick
You're just a doggy, in a snap you're fetching the bone
And you're barking when she calls
You're hiding behind the fence, you've been disobedient

Your fun and playfulness is so very becoming
But she has got you by the reins, and there is no running
Conditioned to salivate at the first sound of the bell
And feeding you the remains of yesterday's meal

Can you hear her calling from within the house?
Well you're just a doggy, in a snap you're fetching the bone
And you're barking when she calls
You're hiding behind the fence, you've been disobedient

If you would stop barking, she might let you out
At last she opens the back gate, you're released
You're now free to roam you've been waiting
For this moment for sometime and now you must go
Into the fields where there is laughter
There is peace and you're comfortable

Get back to the show 'cause it's payday

Rock the city with the number one sound
Long beat, long beach and it feels so fine
Rock this shit straight back to Anaheim

That someone just like you has come again
You'll never, never know how close you came
Until you fall in love with the diamond rain
Throw all his trash away
Look out he's here to stay
Your mirror's gonna crack when he breaks into it
And you'll never never be the same
Look into his eyes and you can see
Why all the little kids are dressed in dreams
I wonder how he's gonna make it back
When he sees that you just know it's make-belief
Blood crystallized as sand
And now I hope you'll understand
You reflected into his looking glass soul
And now the mirror is your only friend
Look into his eyes and you will see
That men are not alone on the diamond sea
Sail into the heart of the lonely storm
And tell her that you'll love her eternally",,https://genius.com/Yeah-yeah-yeahs-diamond-sea-lyrics

Por las ansias que en mi ser tú dejaste
Sentí mi alma deambular, ya moribunda
En una vaga penumbra
Añorando un nuevo amor
Que me hiciera renacer, renacer
Pero hoy, ese amor nuevo ha venido
Y se encuentra aquí conmigo
Ha borrado mi tristeza
Y mi vida ha renacido
Por eso comprendo hoy
Que tú fuiste una ilusión pasajera
Que tu ser me consumió como un vicio
Que te adoré solo por capricho
Y que el verdadero amor, lo tengo ahora

Me sabes provocar
Sóla tus caricias
Me pueden excitar

Dime que eres mío

Dime que eres mío
Quiero imaginarme que tus manos
Corren par mi cuerpo lentamente

Yo he esperado
Sentirás lo mismo que siento ya
Cuando estás a mi lado
Sabrás que nadie podrá igualar
Lo que te he dado
Soy toda tuya

Quiero tenerte, quédate conmigo

Te acaricio al despertar
No me sientes

Aunque te quise ayer, más te quiero hoy
Me conoces más que a ti, me comprendes

Mis sueños de ayer ya son realidad
Y sé que sin tu amor no hay felicidad
Tú sabes quererme, no hay nadie mejor
Y sólo tú has librado mi pasión
Tú sabes quererme, no hay nadie mejor
Mi mundo gira sólo por tu amor
Aunque trate de expresar sentimientos
No hallo forma de explicar lo que siento
Yo sé que tanto amor no se puede mostrar
Pero lo intentaré una eternidad
Tú sabes quererme, no hay nadie mejor
Y sólo tú has librado mi pasión
Tú sabes quererme, no hay nadie mejor

Might be in your arms at last

Hold fast
When someone looks into your eyes
Don't refuse their love
You can't live the rest of your life

And he shoots you dead and he eats your head

You eat Cadillacs, Lincolns too
Mercurys and Subaru
And you don't stop, you keep on eating cars
Then when there's no more cars you go out at night
And eat up bars where the people meet
Face to face, dance cheek to cheek
One to one, man to man
And toe to toe, don't move too slow
Cause the man from Mars is through with cars
He's eating bars, yeah wall to wall
Door to door, hall to hall
He's gonna eat 'em all

Through the sewer, don't strain your brain
Paint a train, you'll be singing in the rain
Said don't stop to the punk rock

Well now you see what you wanna be
Just have your party on TV
Cause the man from Mars won't eat up bars
Where the TV's on and now he's gone
Back up to space where he won't have a hassle

Take me, then lose me, then tell them I'm yours
Are you, happy?

Does it take you a long time?
Does it make you upset?
Does it make you think everybody wants to be your friend?
I can give you a heartbeat, I can give you a friend
I can make you think, everybody wants to be your friend

Drinking with your cell phone with a smile on your face
Happy in success, but still a thousand miles away
Is this what you wanted, is this everything you had in store?

Take me, then lose me, then tell them I'm yours
Are you, happy?

Does it take you a long time?
Does it make you upset?
Does it make you think everybody wants to be your friend?
I can give you a heartbeat, i can give you a friend
I can make you think, everybody wants to be your friend

Take me, then lose me, then tell them I'm yours
Are you, happy?

I've been running circles round a night that never ends
I've been chasing heartache, in a city and a friend
I've been with you so long, even seen you lose it, but, who cares?

Does it take you a long time
Does it make you upset
Does it make you think everybody wants to be your friend
I can give you a heartbeat, I can give you a friend
I can make you think, everybody wants to be your friend

Take me, then lose me, then tell them Im yours
Take me, then lose me, then tell them I'm yours
Take me, then lose me, then tell them I'm yours
Take me, then lose me, then tell them I'm yours",2017-03-21,https://genius.com/Blondie-long-time-lyrics

Your voice across the line gives me a strange sensation
I'd like to talk when I can show you my affection

I look at your life and your style
I wanted nothing more
I know you wouldn't go
You'd watch my heart burst then you'd step in
I had to know so I asked

Walking the line, you were a marksman
Told me that law, like wine, is ageless
Public defender
You had to admit
You wanted the love of a sex offender

I know you wouldn't go
You'd watch my heart burst then you'd step in
I had to know so I asked
You just had to laugh

My vision in blue, I call you from inside my cell
And in the trial, you were there
With your badge and rubber boots

I think all the time how I'm going to perpetrate love with you

Know that your life is more frightening than writing a song
It's an action of fractions you're passing along
And these oceans of emotion will crash once they hit the shore, I promise you
And it's the closest I will get to sincerity
The praise I make just looks so fake and cruel to me
And it's the closest I will come to purity

You know all too well you cannot make things perfect
No, I'll be shifting through lists of these possible loves
With this pain in my brain it feels scattered like doves
Through this sky where my eyes have been drifting towards recently
And it's the closest I can be to egocentricity
This overwhelming sense of rejection will sneak up behind and tear at me
And it'll slam me to the ground into reality
And I'll deal with my disparity

Do you love me now?
Do you love me now?
Do you love me now?
Do you love me now?
Why don't you love me now?
Why don't you love me now?

Though it never helped me forget

29,Blondie,Love Level,Pollinator ,"Elevator's on the rise
Ridin' me up into the sky
Liftin' to you sudden(?)
Numbers up above the door
Countin' down but going up
Climbing floor to floor
I wear my highest heels
I want to feel proximity
When you're with me
All, all I wanna do
Is level off, level it off with you
Everyone can see
That you got inches on me
But when we're lying down
The difference diminishes

What goes up must go down
Lookin' up at the love we found
Gotta get to you somehow
I can barely reach you now

I'm on my tippy-toes
Cause eye-to-eye is challenging
Ooh, I'm balancing 
I put my lips where they belong
A kissing marathon
Let's meet up there next time
And level out when we arrive
The size will equalise us
All, all I wanna do
Is level off, level it off with you
And my condition is clear
The height of an absurdity
But when we're lying down
The difference is minimal

What goes up must go down
Lookin' up at the love we found
Gotta get to you somehow
I can barely reach you now

Opposites attract you know
No rules, no right or wrong
Cause when the love is strong
Everybody fucks Tall John

Learn, you never learn
You never leave me in the park
Dinner after dark
Learn, you never learn
You never ridin' to the floor

She wasn't history. She's just a number
One day she gets her final pay
And she goes far away
Green trees call to me
I am free but life is so cheap
Scenery is still outside of me
All alone, trapped by its beauty

Shayla turned to run away
To leave in peace and end her stay

Lost in space and down she came

Suddenly some subtle entity
Some cosmic energy brushed her like shadows

One on a million wasn't good enough for me

You can read my hand, I've got no defense
When you sent your messages whispered loud and clear
I am always touched by your presence dear
Floating past the evidence of possibilities
We could navigate together, psychic frequencies
Coming into contact with outer entities
We could entertain each one with our theosophies

Stay awake at night and count your R.E.M.'s when you're talking with your super friends
Levitating lovers in the secret stratosphere

And if I didn't give it all to you
Would you lose interest?
Show me indifference?
Foot in another shoe?

Not very high heels
Not wearing sneakers too
A magazine ad, a printed canvas
A basic new shade blue suede shoe
Thought I'd like to have a little party
Thought I'd like to have a little do
Sure I stopped drinking but for the moment
Honey, here's looking at you

I'll stop my drinking, give you my promise true
Clean out the closet, be existential
And cast a vote for the president too

54,Blondie,Bermuda Triangle Blues (Flight 45),Plastic Letters,"Flight 45 was last seen alive on the runway
Leaving for some fun in the hot tropic sun
Back next Monday
And our friends are at the airport
Cousin Bill says, ""Enjoy the water sports""
As we fly into the mystery
The film comes on and the Earth recedes, oh
Several hours out - 20 minutes south of Bermuda
The communication's gone - something has to be so wrong
And it must be Jesus calling
The silver ship, the blue sea falling
Death was in that poison wave and in its gulf a fitting grave
The coast guard said they might be found
They know just where the plane went;
Down",,https://genius.com/Blondie-bermuda-triangle-blues-flight-45-lyrics
55,Blondie,Fan Mail,Plastic Letters,"I set my hand to writing you
It drifted off the page
I sold my one vision for a piece of the cake
I haven't ate in days
For unspoken value, aesthetic and charm
I'd smile at you sideways
But the lighting is wrong, I'm taking a picture and counting the cost
While the bells in my ears keep ringing

I set my hand to writing you
It drifted of the page
I nearly fell, I feel like a lowlife in hell
And I haven't slept in days and days, days and days

Beat on my Fender through my Gemini 2
Play to the posters on the wall of my room
Thought I was crazy when I'd think about you

In my ear bells are ringing",,https://genius.com/Blondie-fan-mail-lyrics

The boy in the back on his second attack
Wants his baby back (wants his baby back)
What's all that commotion that you hear?
The girl in the back who was doing the quake
Got a belly-ache, she can't concentrate
Pick up the beat, you can move like you're made out of vapor
""Catch me if you can"" is what she said with her hands
Come on and take me back (can you take her back?)
When she gives you the beat and you get the shine
The world slows down and she stops on a dime
Got a number when you close your eyes
Like a real magician
Still she knows she'll never lose a thing
She can put you up on a shelf until she wants to pull the string
Still you know she'll never slip away
Keep time in your head, counting in your head

Slow motion, I can play with time
I can keep today but tomorrow's fine
Stop and look at the pictures rolling in your head
Slow motion, you can play with time
You can leave her today but tomorrow's fine
Stop and live in your dreams at night
Rolling in your bed

Slow motion, you can stop on a dime
Slow motion, you ought to try it sometime
Take me back on another track
Take me back, take me back
Slow motion, you can pick up the beat
Slow motion, you can stop on the street
Take me back on another track
Take me back, take me back
Slow motion, you can stop on a dime
Slow motion, you ought to try it sometime
Take me back on another track
Take me back, take me back
Slow motion, you can pick up the beat
Slow motion, you can stop on the street

You caught me surprised and my will resigned. Torture the minds of them all

Why did he run, run away from me?

And golden sands are calling out to you inviting
Make a new man out of you

I got my papers and a cyanide pill
My Polaroid's a taser in disguise
There's a base in the hills
And the wheat fields looks like Kansas in November

Astrovia, sweet comrade, your nation is your gun
Your love reads like the broken code you sent me
One last contact in red square, unless I have to run
And the long arms of the KGB detect me

Can't trust a soul, secret messenger
Just the rules that lie like circuits in your brain
And a cool .45. The wind is ice and foreign air tastes strange

I.C.B.M. Bang! Bang! You're dead!

You tanned your oily body looking like sin

You slipped into the water from too much grease

Well, I saw you yelling. I just couldn't hear
So I screamed back at you ""Honey keep the beer!""

Moving streets all make me lonely
Come to me and be mine only
I can hide us far from sight
But you must wait and I must fight;
This nothingness
Walls, I see my little room
I hear my parent's friends
I hope that my actions make amends
I would like to kill for love, but I don't know how
Here I lie so high above the crowd
Busy streets all make me lonely
Come to me and be mine only
I can move us through the night
But you must wait and I must fight;
This emptiness
Black top burns with silent screams
Others stop my dreams
Lightning crash, crash, crash!
Fear causes some to live
Others die real cool
I died in the evening after school
Be mine only
Be my own
Be mine only
Be my own",,https://genius.com/Blondie-youth-nabbed-as-sniper-lyrics

He has one up here, one down there
One in the city, one down the shore
One is a lawyer, one is a doctor
One of them works with a little contractor
One down East, one down West
He has one up North and two down South
And one sells pot
And she keeps on hanging out


He has one in school, one big fool fool
He has one every time I say she thinks she rules
One is a nurse, she says she come first
The other night them going out and pick her a new purse
One is a star, one works in a bar
She can smile when the two of them spar
One get get, one fret fret
He won't drink no other milk but Betty
Too girly girly

Not the answer for princes and dancers

He's thinking of his old life
He lost his pretty young wife
The corner is his big plan
His brunch with Jim and jitters
Boston blue laws isn't for shitters
And newsprint is for cheaters
Cement mattress for believers

A dirty old bum
He's a dirty old bum
He can't say ""Yes""
He can't forget it A dirty old bum

Laughing down the sun like a jackal will
With his eyes ablaze and his lips apart
He's gonna fill his cup with the love in your heart
And drink it up till the morning starts
Circulate the red light this is get the girls and get the sis'
Pinch him up and give em bliss
Kissin fears with all his might forever

Standed on the verge of the edge of the ledge
Waitin for me to fall, then I got a call
It said, ""WAIT HOLD UP HOMEY, YOU MUST BE TRIPPIN
YOU CAN'T BE PUTTIN THAT STRIPPIN AND WHIPPIN
UP IN YOUR PIMPIN, YOU BETTER STAND TALL
FOOL YOU WAS BORN TO BALL
TOOK A LITTLE FALL AND NOW YOU WANNA END IT ALL
YOU BEEN CHASIN DREAMS LIKE A HOUND DOG ON THE HUNT
Take your place in the front wit yo' hands on the blunt
And it's right in your grasp man, I know they laughin
BUT YOU'LL BE LAUGHIN LATER CUZ TIMES IS GON' GET GREATER!""

That's when you least expect it
You understand there is no exit

Aiyyo rock that *shit*, slamdance to this
Move the *fuck* back when you see us in the mosh pit
Smash something when my heavy metal raps thump in
Crack more heads open than Beck's, you and your mans floated
Tales From The Crypt, Rocky Horror couldn't Picture it
Spine-tingling, give you goose bumps singin it
*Bitch-ass niggas* scared to party wit The Infamous
We jumpin over the bar snatchin mad liquors

Out of the darkness, spark this total chaos
Mark to scheme the hardest, nothing can save us
All that is sacred, dearly departed
Braveheart slave brave contains something courageous
Salute shining armor, persona rip stages
Loud as Nirvana, beneath the golden ages
The road rash explode, little rigor that devour
Don't cry for me, I'm bout drunk off the power
Chorus  2x
Who's gonna cry for ya
Who's gonna cry over you

Now if you think my Infamous Mobb remains untamed
And we out for the cash while you out for the fame
Lay back, count on my stack down to Cognac
Writin my raps, here hold that, it's bound to go plat
When my bang hits, relentless, whatever I spit
Like a fresh pair of kicks outta the box, ready to rock
You know the drilly stay collaboratin wit my committee
Then it's on the L-I-E to QB city

Yo yo
We storm the sound clash, but none heard the sound of the blast
Send the mass outta control, the system found smash
There's blood on the dance floor, they still chant ""More!""
The nitty gritty, New York inner city
Fifty caliber thoughts force the world to bang wit me
Bound to hit hard like twenty gods benchin in the yard
Men at large take charge, out to make ours and take ours
We fought against all odds

Ya stunned momentarily, dropped seconds after

Gunned down the 70s

Why do you act the way you do?

Would we wake or take the ride

Trophies and rhythms, stars for the higher scores
So long, let the cheaters and words that worked before

Those are the breaks like musical chairs
When you're last standing, well fair is fair
Those are the breaks, I'll call your bluff
Overexposure, enough is enough
I don't want a contest, too many pitfalls
I don't want your money, stale bread for 
As darts hit the target see the feathers fly
And busted we feelin', piñata surprise

You can't play if you're the middle man
You can't stay unless you win again

Those are the breaks, I'll still pull and try

I get so bored with his shtick and his mini-minute dick
And all his high and mighty shit, I'm a witch

Your slab rat white as a tic-tac
Why don't you take a dirt nap
You make me laugh and I know who I'm laughing at

Like your dirty thoughts, like your Cream of Wheat

Your act is a contortion
The perfume and pretension
Your hair in invention

But there's still more coming
Put it in, put it in, put it in, why don't you put it in
You said your name was what
What kind of a name is that
Shooting past me on the turnpike
Should have told you to take a hike
But there was something
I don't know what
That I guess I kind of like, that nasty attitude
Mediterranean lastitude
I guess you did give me a rush
Yeah you gave me a thrill
Felt so hot and flushed
I even had to take a pill
And your pattern yeah your method yeah
The way you deliver long and slow
The way you get your percussion going
Going strong, and it's my turn to be blowing
Yeah singing my song
You think you know me
Think again
Who's your friend
Who put this freak flag in the mail
Why you sending me this pig tail
You back in Jail
I got your post card saying
How it is in that pen you're in
Signed don't forget me, lots of love from adrenaline
Give it a rest, give it a rest
You got one dimension pure pretension
Cross the river start to shiver
Over to the big smoke, and it's no joke
I told you one more word from you
About Jersey and you're dead
Let me lick that uh uh
Can I kiss that, no
Let me kiss that
Let me lick that come on

112,Blondie,Dragonfly,The Hunter,"Greetings ladies and gentlemen of Earth and all native intelligences of the forty planets with contestants entered in the annual Grande Trex, the only inter-universe race
This year’s event promises excitement to surpass all previous races. As many of you fans know already the route or track of the race has been increased by five thousand million kilometres, thus allowing the Grande Trex to include the B-Arc  system!
Dragonfly, dragonfly
Satellite; strike and fight
Laser light shot tonight
Target nullified
Gyro subdivide
Latitude; longitude
Satellite; solid substitute
Dragonfly; are revise
What’s a drag race?
Can’t you see those dragons speeding up the street?
But I learned they weren’t real;
Figments of the ancient fear
Rapid scan; radians
For the chance to the win the Grande
Manoeuvres; pre-program windage
Won’t operate, negative;
Bearing swell
Dragons fly, they symbolise in myth and saga breathing fire
Look up, there’s one flying higher;
Faster than the SSC
Is science hiding witchery?
Grande Trex fans throughout the universe are well informed on the risks the pilots take in entering this race
Re-entry into some of the alien atmospheres is tricky business which can cause a craft to implode; explode; melt; lose atomic structure and so forth, adding to the interstellar terrain that on its own is a terrific danger to the ships en route
The craft are scheduled to launch at oh-seven-five-one-hundred Greenwich Mean Time and assembled on one our very own stars, Neutron Einstar EV9
And the excitement is at a fever pitch as the countdown approaches zero!
Dragonfly, rations glide
In free fall slide
Systems nullified
Satellite; dragonfly
Surface launch; radio silence
Hover high; level off
The time space tactics saved us then
Display report present; urgent
Sequence counting; surface launch
Dragonfly destroying all!
Science claiming newest findings
Chanting, calling flying dragons
Aboard all systems optimum
Nova scheduled war continued
Half the continental shelf burned by interval;
Interval
We have retained an added feature for daring thrills and excitement in this race — a feature which I’m sure you’re going to like — a computer override lasting three and half and hours or two gens in which pilots and copilots manually control free fall; latitude; longitude; protract gravity; revise dimensional equations, run program checks, submerge in the wild oceans of Jonrin 22, and photograph as much territory and terrain as they can in addition to the requisite three thousand automatic shots
The postulate for mischance runs high, but not as high as the tension and competitive spirit right here and all over the galaxy!
Dragonfly, dragonfly
Beacons aim; space game
(Countdown is negative two hundred and I am turning you over to the control room and command central. Sua Lan for the launch.)
Satellite; computerised
(Good luck to all the entrants and especially to our own ship, the Dragonfly!)
Hypersonic glide
(Beacons, lasers, quasars mounted on deck; rapid survey reactor; failsafe radians)

Win the race
Calibrate re-entry place
(Extra points awarded for city salvage delivered at the finish line, preferably retaining molecular identity.)
Multi failsafe

And the colour of the Nile

But it's older than you think

Sometimes your eyes remind me
Don't know why
I'll wait a lifetime till you find me

Mmmm I've been this way before
Mmmm I'll come this way again

So many things inside me

Some hands can't make it on the run, under the gun
Not for the younger

I know you did your best, but you thought that you did not
I wish that I had known before I heard the last shot
You know, it's not a sin, that little badge of tin
Just a momento
So sad you loved in vain
My comrades lost in battle
The music wars are done from London to Seattle
We all pay to play and all our yesterdays are starting over

We wanna run

We gotta run

Get out among the hot nightclubs
And find some love
Billions of people have heard of me
And everybody knows the sun rises in the East
Not too nice, not too sweet, no one even talks to me
I shake the leaves right off the trees, I'm the bee's greasy knees
I shake 'em, I break 'em
I drop 'em from eight miles high
Alright

In the past my fate was cast, my social life was limited
To Halloween and New Years Eve, monotony was killing me;
Approaching schizophrenia!
I hit the hot spots every night
And, for the first time in my life
The bouncers would greet me
The doormen would escort me
Managers adored me
Photographers would follow me
Begging for a smile; ""Beast, over here Beast!"", ""Here Beast!""
The hat check always said to me
""Hiya B, whatcha doing later?""
We want fun
We gotta run
If you need fun
Get out and run
You need fun for feeling fine
We want fun for feeling fine
And find the one
Now I'm not bragging
Heaven knows, I spend no more nights alone
Lucky me, I'm ten foot three and freaky
And my picture's been reprinted
And interviews requested
One hundred times a week
Believe it, I'm not talking through my teeth
Are you sure you got it?
I need it, to prove it
I'm in the news, it's true, it's true!
Check it out, check it out!
He wants her love
She wants love
I take action, get relief, pick a partner, pick a piece
Get satisfaction; I am the Beast, I am the Beast
She wants fun
He wants her love
I get satisfaction, I pick up my feet
I'm the center of attraction by staying on the streets

And I want love

Can stop watching, what you see, if what you work with, you look at me

Can’t take the place of work, that you used to do
I’m like a pebble in my shoe, you’re on my mind
So they’re sent to make the passages of time
Can’t stop wanting, what you watch, so when you get, (some you don’t)
Can’t stop watching, what you see, it’s what you work with, look at me

I would try to be a lucky star, like the yellow shard, so bright
It’s time to face those other breaks, but I don’t mind
Pages of history or pictures sublime
Your drink tequila like it’s little sips of wine
You’re looking for excitement and you’ve got your eye on mine

And you know my wishes are sincere
What's to say, for the days I cannot bare

A Sunday smile, you wore it for a while
A cemetery mile, we paused and sang
A Sunday smile, you wore it for a while
A Sunday smile and we felt true

We burnt to the ground, left a view to admire
Buildings aside, church of white
We burnt to the ground, left a grave to admire
And as we reach for the sky, reach the church of white",2011-05-30,https://genius.com/Blondie-sunday-smile-lyrics
122,Blondie,Forgive and Forget (Pull Down the Night),No Exit,"In the beginning, in the days before time, the light was alive with the essence of power
And from that power were born beings who lived on the edge of eternity
And they spread their wings and soared through the ancient air
And the beating of their wings made the winds
And from the winds came the seas
And from the sea came the life of the earth

Nature's cast upon the sea the winds of past, of promise be
Waters deep uncover me
A scheme of sleep as lovers three

If you'll forgive me my ferocity, I won't forget your sweetness
Pull down the night, lay it before me
Gratify my head with curses

Night recalls tranquility
A curtain falls and sets it free
Darkness calls eternity
Down silent halls the shadows flee

If you'll forgive me my ferocity, I won't forget your sweetness
Pull down the night, lay it before me
Satisfy my head with curses

Forgive and forget
Forgive and forget
Forgive and forget

Fates are cast upon the sea
The winds of past of promise be
Waters deep uncover me
A scheme of sleep as lovers three

Get to the bottom and the womb will turn

I'm as tense as
A high noon run
I'm going to cross that bridge

Getting over
Stepping up
I'm at the end of a stretch
Wearing high heels that fit
Crossing Diamond Bridge
The street was straight
Straight and narrow
The bridge was not
I'm going to burst my seams
Know what temptation means
Days were old
And nights got hot
Feel the difference, it feels fine
It fills my mind field with friendly fire
I'm not throwing my pearls to swine
I'm crossing Diamond Bridge
I don't want go there
But I can't stay here
Just a shiny baby
In the bright light's glare
If I cross that line
Break the ties that bind
Stepping over
Wrong and right
Gonna raise the stakes
I'm staying wide awake
Crossing over
Growing up
I feel the difference and it feels fine
It fills my mind field with friendly fire
And melts the ice off my desire

I wear the spell you put on me
Like a charm no one else can see
Keeps away the wicked badly meant for me


And when I thought my fire finally died, I felt your spell, tight as ever, tied

No one is above the rituals of love
Temptation calls and the stars fall from the blue

Raising waves of heat
I press on in tiny bursts of speed

Caught in my pursuit, I play the fetishist admission
The longing that I feel drives me mad in no direction
Nailed by something cute, I tear it out with micro-surgical precision

Incender
Put some gas on the ember
Lightning goes to ground

Incender
Crazy fool on a bender
Striking the ground
Burning me down

Double take
Left with an aftertaste
I look again
Was it your face?

Double take
I'm in an altered state
I look again
Was it really you?

Another flash of face, igniting and familiar pulls me by the eye to the perimeter
Riveting my gaze
Is that your face in the crowd?

Incender
Drop some gas on the ember
I felt a slap on the face

Incender
Crazy fool on a bender
Striking the ground, burning me down

Anytime the hunter gets captured by the game

Hoping you might fall into it

I greet bad news by sending it walking

And we try to create it again, again
To deny the laws and to leave it behind

Sing sweet songs of love to me now
So the night will become one of love
Sing sweet songs of love to me now
For I need to know you're mine

All of our days we long for a chance
To be lost in a trance of a love we share
A romantic love like no other before
All of our days we live on the run
But we try to believe that it's just begun
That we'll have the time to enjoy every day

And I chase after you

My words cannot express your awful loveliness
So come with me through smoke and mirrors
We'll bring our differences nearer
We'll float upon an inland sea
Embody visions of a dream
And I chase every night after you
I got a chill, and the night wind sent me a chill
And the night wind sent me a chill

You wander through my sleeping mind, reading thoughts I've left behind

Your wife should know
You say you wanna put me on some TV show
The Johnny Carson show?
Come on, let's go!
You say you wanna buy me leather coats and cars
Make me a star, take a trip to Mars
I did it
I got it
I got the jewel
I made it
I paid it
And I'm no fool
Compliments and promises can't fool me twice
You're such a low-life schemer

Beat it creep

Breaking the mojo
Dig up the conjo
Making me well

Who do you love?

You're a mess
Got a gun to your head
And drums in the night
Going blind
Hypnotized

Lost in the Congo
Holding the bongo
Kilimanjaro
Dig up the conjo

Listen to drums for the name
Little hearts beat like saints come marching in
Deep in the bayou
Demon inside you
Put on the hoo doo
Put on the hoo doo

Who do you love?

""Hey mommy, do you see that man? Hey mommy, I don't understand""
""It's only a zombie, honey, hailing a cab. Just hold my hand and don't look in his face""

Jungle inside you
Something's beside you
Doing the mambo
Dig up the conjo

Who do you love?
A loa down the well
Come and ring the bell
The jungle's burning down!

Lost in the Congo
Beating the bongo
Dig up the conjo

Who do you love?

To confess in the sun hold your breath
Something comes
It's alright
Half alive
Watching you while it flies

Lost in the Congo

Beating my bongo
Holding the mojo

We go inside it, ran head long into it
And mothers' warning, useless to me

And you can see me drinking the poison
Taking it happily

We be living in a vacuum
We be looking for a fight
In the backroom we be drinking all night
We be running out of headroom
We be looking for a fight
Crowd was thinning out
And he came through the door
I look right at him
He looks at the floor
Awkward glances catch the thread long ago
I'm seeing red
Does your sister dress you up
Does the devil know you're dead
I don't know if Gabriel keeps a place for me
I still want to go to heaven & see what I can see
I don't want to have St Peter close the gate on me
I still want to get to heaven & be what I can be
We had moved to the place
I heard them say 'Last Call'
I stepped over all of them
And walked on down the hall
The man says not to wait for judgment
It comes everyday
Absolution at a price
And we all have to pay
In the backroom we be drinking all night
We be living in a vacuum

Taking me out of town

Messing me round and round

To a driving dimension, do it again
Hey, I am standing on top of the world
Grinning and spinning, free as a bird

Fallen by fear
Blood on the sidewalk
Staining the rest of the year

Alone in the sky
An older invention
Comes from a native reply
Raised by a shout and a cry

And I listen to this
To this voice out of pitch
The excitement or the panic of girls
And all that I heard had its own kind of reason
Was it really the end of the world?

I know you feel guilty and it's driving you wild
But the weight you've been shedding is heading to the critical side
A vanishing act just to hide
How else can I put it?
What more can I say?
An ounce of truth diminishes everything that you said
It's your turn to put things away
He told me he talks to the buildings
He told me he speaks to the sky
Once he conversed with a road full of holes
While he whispered his little white lies


You love the lightning, thunder and all
Talk to the pavement
Listen to the will and the call
Voices come out of the wall
Some other surface
Standing alone
Points of remembrance only help sharpen the tone
Sharpen right down to the bone

Perfect wave, hurricane eye
Tropic haze, pineapple sky

The way is long, but you can make it easy on me
And the mother we share
Will never keep our cold heart from calling

In the dying light, I’m the only one here
And I will cover you, until you go-o-o-oh
'Cause if I told the truth, I would always be free
And keep a prize with me, until you go-o-o-oh

Come in misery, where you can seem as old as your omens

Will never keep our cold heart from calling

Into the night, for once, we’re the only ones left
I bet you even know, where we could go-o-o-oh
And when it all fucks up, you put your head in my hands
It’s a souvenir for when you go-o-o-oh

Take care to tell on me for the cause
I know I need to feel released
Take care to bury all that you can
Take care to leave a trace of a man

I will show restraint
Just like we said we should
You think I'll apologize for things I left behind
But you got it wrong
And I'm as sane as I ever was

You talk far too much
For someone so unkind
I will wipe the salt off of my skin
And I'll admit that I got it wrong
And there is grey between the lines

Like it always was

Holding to a hope you'll undermine, never to be reversed

Holding on tightly to the sides, never quite learning why

If ever I try to push away, you can just keep me, tell me

Always we can sing, we can make time
Old songs, flood and flame, you could be mine
But you got to show me, both knees, skin and bone
Clothe me, throw me, move me 'til

I can sell you lies
You can't get enough
Make a true believer of
Anyone, anyone, anyone
I can call you up
If I feel low
I can feed your dirty mind
Like I know, like I know what you want

Icon of symmetry, swallowing sides
Fall down in front of me, follow my eyes
But I've got to see you moving, waste no time
Teach me, make me holy 'til

And I want you
Now and for all time

I communicate in simple streams (take your time)
I'm the only one who gave you the truth (speak to me)
Once you leave me you were really gone (far and near)
Give me something to remember you by (always be)
All that's here is what you left behind (majesty)
Slowly moving in the back of my mind (can't forget)
Take a moment to remember me (and i will)
And make me blind so I don't ever look back

Because all your words are so cold, so callous, so clean

If you could start remembering, all the time that you used up
And you could be my remedy
If you could show me love
If I could stop remembering, all the time that you used up

I got no more time to hear who you think we should blame
Because all your words are so vile, so vicious, so vain
In the end, we did all the damage that you could want, want
But the emptiness will go on and on

When we're played out by the band drowning out our sorrows
What will become of us now at the end of time?
We'll be fine, you and I
Let's draw a line in the sand, keep it straight and narrow
We had it all in our hands, we begged and then we borrowed
What will become of us all at the end of love
When we've stopped looking up?

You can take my heart
And hold it together as we fall apart
Maybe together we can make a mark in the stars we embark
And keep us together as the lights go dark

Let's tell the truth, just for once, asking for an answer
Now that it's all said and done, nothing really matters
What will become of us all if we dare to dream
At the end of the scene?

You can take my heart
Hold it together as we fall apart
Maybe together we can make a mark in the stars we embark
And keep us together as the lights go dark

Let's open up to the sky, askin' it for closure
'Least we can say that we tried, but it's never really over
What will become of us all at the end of the line?
Will we live? Will we die?

And hold it together as we fall apart
Maybe together we can make a mark in the stars we embark
And keep us together as the lights go dark

I would leave you, every time

Then they hung out, but you came home around three
Now if six of ya'll went out, then four of you were really cheap
'Cause only two of you had dinner - I found your credit card receipt

I'm gonna make it anyway
Pack your bags up and leave
Don't you dare come running back to me
It's not right, but it's okay
I'm gonna make it anyway

I'd rather be alone than unhappy

I'll pack your bags so you can leave town for a week, yes I am
The phone rings and then you look at me
Why'd you turn and look at me?
You said it was one of your friends down on 54th Street, boy
So why did 213 show up on your caller ID?

(Oh, I've been through all this before)
I've been through all this before

Don't think about it, don't think about it
(That I would stand around and take some more)
Get gone, get gone

You don't stand a chance, boy
(That's why you have to leave)
You don't stand a chance
(So don't turn around to see my face)
Don't you turn around
There's no more tears left here for you to see

Was it really worth you going out like that?
See, I'm moving on and I refuse to turn back
See, all of this time I thought I had somebody down for Whitney
It turns out you were making a fool of me

Do you ever get the feeling that you can't shift the tide
That sticks around like something in your teeth?
There's some aces up your sleeve
I have no idea that you're in deep
I've dreamt about you nearly every night this week
How many secrets can you keep?
'Cause there's this tune I found
That makes me think of you somehow
And I play it on repeat
Until I fall asleep
Spilling drinks on my settee

If this feeling flows both ways?

Ever thought of calling when you've had a few?
'Cause I always do
Maybe I'm too busy being yours to fall for somebody new
Now I've thought it through

So have you got the guts?
Been wondering if your heart's still open
And if so, I wanna know what time it shuts
Simmer down and pucker up
I'm sorry to interrupt, it's just I'm constantly on the cusp
Of trying to kiss you
And I don't know if you feel the same as I do
We could be together if you wanted to

And the atmosphere is charged
In you I trust
And I feel no fear as I
Do as I must

Give up yourself unto the moment
The time is now
Give up yourself unto the moment
Let's make this moment last

Give up yourself unto the moment
The time is now
Give up yourself unto the moment
Let's make this moment last

Tempted by fate
And I won't hesitate
The time is now
And I can't wait
I've been empty too long
The time is now
Pretending that it's gone
And the time has come
Let's make this moment last
And the night is young
The time is now
Let's make this moment last

Give up yourself unto the moment
The time is now
Give up yourself unto the moment
Let's make this moment last",2000-03-20,https://genius.com/Moloko-the-time-is-now-lyrics
1,Moloko,Sing It Back (Album Version),I Am Not a Doctor,"When you are ready
I will surrender
Take me and do as you wish
Have what you want
Your way's always the best way
I have succumbed to
This passive sensation
Peacefully falling away
I am a zombie
Your wish will command me
Laugh as I fall to my knees

Can I control
This empty delusion
Lost in the fire below?
And you come running
Your eyes will be open
And when you come back
I'll be as you want me
Only so eager to please
My little song will
Keep you beside me
Thinking your name as I sing

Sing it back to me
Sing it back to me

Now you can't help it
If you have been tempted
By fruit hanging ripe on the tree
And I feel useless
Don't care what the truth is
You will be here come the day
Truth do you hear me?
Don't try to come near me
So tired, I sleep through the light
If you desire to
Lay here beside me

I was wired to a clock
I tickled by the minute hand
Tick tock, tick tick tock
I dream I'm on a train
And it is making music
I don't remember getting on
Clickity click, clickity click
I dreamt that I was very tall
I was bigger than King Kong
I heard the bells, the bells
Are ringing, a ding dong, a ding dong
I dream that I am sitting
In the devil's company
He gave a solemn promise
Fe fi fo, fun for me

I dreamt that I was chasing
The monster out of me
I caught him in the corner
Ha ha, hee hee hee hee
I dream I'm in a tunnel
Between here and now
Scooby Doobie, a-where would you be?
Bow wow wow wow
I dream I'm at a crossroads
No place left to go
I look in each direction
Eenie meanie miny mo
I dream that I am spying
It's you I'm looking at
There's a knocking at the window
A rat tat tat tat, a rat tat tat
I dream I am an ostrich
Head deep in the sand
There is a rhythm that's a-playing
Fantastic elastic band

I dreamt that the bogeyman went down on Mr. Spock
Sugar was a flowing, sock it to 'em sock
I dreamt I saw a moo cow jump across the moon
Just a flight of fantasy, zoom zoom zoom
I dreamt I met a spaceman, he took me to his ship
You know he cut my hair off, snip snip snip
I dreamt that I was sleeping, asleep for heaven's sake
The dream that I was dreaming, it caused me to awake

Fe fi fo, fun for me, fun for me

I dreamt I was way up, I was standing on the top
With the feeling I was falling, bop beep bop
I dreamt that I was jumping in a circus through a hoop
Someone shut the lights off, shoo-be-doop
I dreamt that I was fast, I was never shutting up
I was going in a hurry, I was giddy-up giddy-up
I dream I'm in the park, I'm standing in the nudey
I'm getting what I wanted, tutti frutti, tutti frutti

Give it a try, don't be shy
Well, you know you might like it
Never been too keen a timekeeper
But I'm a pure new pleasure seeker
All the way from Venus
Invading from Mars
Don't let that come between us
It's written in the stars
Save me from fading afraid
The tears of a fool on parade
Quietly turn into stone
Make me flesh and bone

Well, come on, oh
You know that you want it now
Well, come on, yeah
You know that you want it and how

Stimulation in body and cell
For the good and misguided
Desperation, I'm under your spell
Misunderstood and derided
Speculation, they kiss and they tell
Misjudged and misquoted
Fell into the abyss, I must have wanted this
Another myth exploded
Take a weight off your mind
Trust the voice of experience
I tell you little white lies
Viva indifference
Stoke up the fire
I'm all you require
They won't set you alight
Come and live your desire

Come make me whole
Body and soul
Come make me whole

Come make me whole, body and soul
Come make me whole, body and soul

Never been too keen a timekeeper
Show me new tricks, you can get me on the beeper

Would be a crime against passion
Not to itch that itch
Oh, don't ask how it happened
This is it, this is it
All we have ever wanted
All we will ever need
Nothing can take its place
It's written all over your face

Hope you're feeling well
Hope you're feeling very clear
In this song and rhyme
Thoughts of changes that
Keep ourselves intact
And yes, it's hard to fake
But I'm faltering
In the steps I'm about to take
I am sure it's true
What is all for me
Is much the same to you

If all the statues in the world
Would turn to flesh with teeth of pearl
Would they be kind enough to comfort me?
The setting sun is set in stone
And it remains for me alone
To carve my own and set it free

So we wait and see
How this backward chapter reads
In verse inadvertently
And it feels like fading light
But that's all that's left
Only what's left is right

If all the statues in the world
Would turn to flesh with teeth of pearl
Would they be kind enough to comfort me?
The setting sun is set in stone
And it remains for me alone
To carve my own and set it free

Jumping from a balloon
Carried aloft by a parachute in June
Twisting round and round
Well I hope the ground is what you find
La la la la la la la la
La la la la la

And it remains for me alone

8,Moloko,Where Is The What If The What Is In Why,Do You Like My Tight Sweater?,"What is a god of phoney creation?
Where am I going with no destination?
What if the fish came from the sea?
What if my lover made me feel free?
What if my intake cause revelation?
What if the point was reincarnation?
What if my shoes don't match my jacket?
If it's not working, why don't you smack it?
What if your mama said you were fat?
If you are lost, find where you are at
One is a number without any time
You can't get higher with nothing to climb
Why have a body if you ain't got a mind?
What is a searching with nothing to find?
Why is the traffic refusing to stop?
Why climb the ladder if you can't reach the top?

Why? Where is the what if the what is in why?
Where is the what if the what is in why?
Where is the what if the what is in why?

What do you dream of when you sleep at night?
See how the blind man fills up with light
What is the bird with nowhere to fly?
How can you leave and not say goodbye?
What is a hunter with nothing to find?
What is the goodness without the unkind?
When did the outfit fall out of fashion?
When did the love fall out of passion?

My reincarnation time
A phoney creation rhyme
With no destination mine
My information's fine

Why did the voice say don't step on the floor?
Why did the sign say to float through the door?
What is a god of phoney creation?
Where am I going with no destination?
What if the fish came from the sea?
What if my lover made me feel free?
What if my intake caused revelation?
What if the point was reincarnation?
What if my shoes don't match my jacket?

How did the looser get to be rich?
What is a salesman with nothing to pitch?
When did the fool get to be king?
Why did you leave when they asked you to sing?
Why lose belief when you've got a dream?
What is a train that ran out of steam?
What is a spy with no one to spy on?
How do you sleep with nothing to lie on?
What if the fruit don't fall from the tree?
What if these questions just won't let you be?
Why waste time looking for proof?
What if the answer is never the truth?",,https://genius.com/Moloko-where-is-the-what-if-the-what-is-in-why-lyrics
9,Moloko,Take My Hand,---,"Pins, needles and butterflies
Into deeper pools I dive
To re-emerge almost submerged
Ultraviolet
Is it slight of hand
Or the surest touch
You caught me as I fell and put me on a pedestal
Can you be sure that's right?
My king of hearts
Are we the only two
To feel so powerless
And yet so powerful
And all at once
We are all at one
So take my hand and
We'll explore the land of mellow truthfulness
Something deep in you
Touches something so deep in me
And suddenly
Destiny lays down in front of me (I feel it)
It's what I was designed to do
To touch something so deep in you
And suddenly awake
Sleeping sensitivity
I was a run away
But what was I running to
You stopped me in my tracks
When I turned back all I could see is you
The wind
Telling tales of golden histories
Whispering among the trees
Of heaven and its mysteries
And soon
We two will commune
Like the spheres of sun and moon
The perfume of the rose in bloom
Something deep in you
Touches something so deep in me
And suddenly
Destiny lays down in front of me (I feel it)
It's what I was designed to do
To touch something so deep in you
And suddenly awake
Sleeping sensitivity
(Touches)

Touches something so deep in me

Every morning which is good
But my stomach's churning, call me
It would be nice if you could
Some days I question
The suggestion
You might not exist at all
Can we meet and talk it over
Would you be kind enough to call
Over and over
It's over all over
And over and over and over
And over.....
No there's no middle ground
Your off in another story
Or merry-go-round
No there'll be no measured terms
You fly in the face of the way the world turns
Like a frozen tidal wave
Since that day I'm standing still
You brought me here and I accept
Though you regret I never will
Just one sweet word
And then a smile from you
Is almost worth everything
I've given all I had to give
But you gave up giving in
You are everywhere I go
All the places we have been
I can't imagine where you are
For you are all I've ever seen

Till your heart is breaking

And your far out, far-flung philosophies
Could not be further from my mind

You are late, I'm still waiting
All of one we need to
But seriously, that drift with me
Get off my cloud
It's reserved for an angel with darker wings

Uncurl and lay the worries of the world

Underachievers take a leap
Tell her the secrets that you keep
So close and yet too far out
Maybe someday you'll hear
Sweet somethings whispered softly
Into your ear

To those with afflictions
Prone to addictions
To users and to losers
Doubters and their daughters and sons
Your angel will come

Maybe she's come and gone
Already lost the one
What have you done
You lost the only one

If you came from something
And you're headed nowhere out on the run
Allow this thought to crystallise
It is better in the long run
To never get there
And let the journey decide
In all this doom and this gloom
And pessimistical visions
Came all condemned men, all fatalists
In metaphysical fear
How could love be here?

To those with afflictions
Prone to addictions
To users and losers
Doubters and their daughters and sons

In all three dimensions
To jokers and to the joke

16,Moloko,I Want You,Statues,"I want you
Though you dare to deny it
I'm always reminded of you
And the more you forbid me
The more I need you to give me

Morning comes upon us to impose another day
Though I might try to force myself to sleep
Why should I face up to another waking day
When there's a chance you'll come to me in dreams
The world just keeps right on turning anyway
While I stay home and watch the shadow play

Innocence is lost into the dark
If I were dynamite would you provide the spark?

I want you
Though you dare to deny it
I am always reminded of you
And the more you forbid me
The more I need you to give me
I don't know what to do
If you dare to deny it
I'm always reminded of you
And the more you forbid me
The more I need you to give me

If only you could see my life
Turning inside out
A heart that keeps attacking me
Always in my mouth
And if my skin were glass, my love, you would see
A heart that keeps on beating only in the hope
That you'll return, to me

I don't know what to do
Though you dare to deny it
I'm always reminded of you
And the more you forbid me
The more I need you to give me
I want you
Though you dare to deny it
I am always reminded of you
And the more you forbid me
The more I need you to give me
I don't know what to do
Though you dare to deny it
I'm always reminded of you
And the more you forbid me

17,Moloko,Should’ve Been Could’ve Been,I Am Not a Doctor,"Some of you will already know there's no place to go
This is the modern man, as good as I am
Here in the heart of the sun my memory melts
Swellegant, elephant pain, he never forgets
Should've been a beautiful thing
Could've been a beautiful thing
Pull over to the side of the road, let the bold be bold
Luxury at a low introductory price, now wouldn't that be nice?
A happy little family puts you in a trance meanwhile back at the ranch
Insatiable hand-held flexible friend, why not give him a chance?
Could've been a beautiful thing
Should've been, could've been a beautiful thing
Promises of pleasure mesmerised, but how far can we get?
At least here in the eye of the storm I won't get my hairdo wet
Some of you have already foreseen yourself undone
Some of you seem to believe you've only just begun
Try a little perjury, get rich quick
My eyes are bigger than my belly is, and it makes me sick
Attitude, so much to prove, should've been a beautiful thing
Some of you will already know, and I'm still wondering
Should've been a beautiful thing
Could've been a beautiful thing
I could've been, should've been, could've been a beautiful thing
Could've been a beautiful thing
Should've been, would've been a beautiful thing

I'm gonna stay awhile

Magnetized, I saw you in the window
I've been watching you
Don't know what else to do
Trust me, I'm sensitive
Intensitive, I'll never let you go
No need to be afraid
Release yourself to me, I got that heart-ache

You know my trouble
I saw you on your own
No need to be alone
Let me levitate
Relax, resonate
Turn off the lights

I have to follow you
So put your honey where your mouth is
Look behind you
Relax and let me hypnotize
I'd like to touch, hmm

Standing in the shadows
I've had my fill of it
Too close to the light
Just for the thrill of it

I wish I could forget it
Said I'd give you the one last chance
I wish I'd never said it
Took a chance and I can't turn back
And I'm living to regret it
Come on, come on to me

Can't slow down, you dictate
The speed of the chase
Bitter sweet bitter's
The way that you taste
I won't waste this passion, it's true
I'm an everyday fool
No rhyme or reason
To the things that I do, ha-ha-ha

Feed me all your lies
Yes, it's a gas
A word to the wise
You're blindingly obvious lately
Doctor, cure me
Somebody take away this
Seed of the devil
In the core of his kiss, ha-ha-ha

Said I'd give you the one last chance
I wish I'd never said it
Took a chance and I can't turn back
And I'm living to regret it

And some things got built in
Their own punishment
The repercussions will
Sure enough be felt, ha-ha-ha
That which does not kill
Will make you stronger
No longer, in these eyes
It's denial
No long or short goodbyes

Baby, you came close
Baby, come closer
And come on to me
Baby, you came close
Baby, come closer
And come on to me
Baby, come closer
Baby, come closer
Baby, come closer

Took a chance and I can't turn back
And I'm living to regret it
Come on, come on to me

We should've stopped at the start, at the start
Should have parted
Do it, finish me off ha-ha-ha

Be my best friend be my baby

Ya burn your fingers on the toasters
Just a fair weather friend
Gone when the summer end
They will look into your eyes
Tell you pretty perfume lies
Slinky slimy lotus eaters jeepers creepers
Get a load of those peepers
Talking all that mumbo jumbo
People pass in solo limbo
See them slip see them slide
But have you seen the nasty side

You're styling makes me trip
Take your place if they could

Ladies of the night would call all hours of the day, every day, all day
Calling for his mommy when the day was done
Yes, he was moving, he was shaking, so lonesome tonight
And his eyes belied his smile awhile
Calling for his mummy but his mummy didn't come

Hands free, nothing touches me
Transmit, remote, unseen, unknown
She's glad to be so very happy
We've placed your call into a queuing system
Listen to the pretty musak play
Let it numb your fragile system
She had a friend to call her own
But now she spends her time alone
What of the cost of growing rough
Put me on hold to shut me up
Just being is bewildering
Disconnect me from what is mine
Call waiting, waiting on the other line
At you leisure, dear
Come get your pleasure here
I'm so glad to be so very happy
And if you need something
Anybody, anything
Just being is bewildering
Call me, dial L-O-V-E
Just being is bewildering
I'll do as I please
I won't get down on bended knees
Kiss and make up, don't you hang up
Stay and play out the whole scene
Try to stay calm

So I risk what I wager
I lost to a chicken shit, never was
Panty sniffer
Got my eye on a cool hand
And I wonder about this dog of a day
Wanted to be a big shot, real hot

Down with the domino
You know

Calling on instinct
Calling the bluff
Telling a tale ten stories high
To the operative
I figured the numbers under pressure
I played by the seat of my pants
Then fate took a twist
Quietly wily
Faking it and waiting for a fluke
Waiting for a sign
By now boggle-eyed
If I believe I will receive
Leaning on the everlasting tree
Hanging in the hands of fate

Down with the domino
You know
Down with the domino
We go

I'm no casino casanova
With the good luck eyes
It's hard to tell who's friend or foe
When you go down like the domino
One-track mind, just digging till I find
The gold at the end of the rainbow
Just keep on going
Though twisted up inside
Her fool heart takes over
And jumps on for the ride

Down with the domino
You know

I need the roulette
To make me forget
Rotating random eyes roll in tandem
Lady look elusive but I do what I can
Better a day as a lion
Than a lifetime as a lamb

Fredies cat in seven lead boots whiskey for the whiskers the shot sure shoots

I didn't last, so fast you blast kinetic energy
I can't erase the memory
If I put a foot wrong
You could laugh out loud, like you've been laughing to yourself all along
Such lies, sweet hush of lullabies
In a small town, loose talk, it kind of gets around
I must reject all that I once believed
I've been deceived
Behind my back
I am quietly and suredly under attack

Downsized, I guess I shouldn't be surprised
Two faced, the time has come to be replaced
Betrayal, tiny minds
Something sinister's going on behind

You were my downfall
See me crawl, one and all
If I could only be a fly on the wall
Nothing is clear
So sincere in my ear
You look so pretty when you sneer
Behind that smile
Sweet child
You were grinding your teeth all the while
Betrayed, low grade
Always delayed
Did you ever have the slightest intention to stay?

And the paint's peeling off of my walls
There's a man outside
In a long coat, grey hat, smoking a cigarette
And now the light fades out
And I wonder what I'm doing in a room like this
And there's a knock on the door
And just for a second I thought I remembered you
So now I'm alone
And now I can think for myself
About little deals
And s.u's
And things I just don't understand
A white lie that night
Or a sly touch at times
I don't think it meant anything to you
So I open the door
It's the 'friend' that I'd left in the hallway
'please sit down'
A candlelit shadow on a wall near the bed
You know I hate to ask
But are 'friends' electric?
Only mine's broke down
And now I've no-one to love
So I found out your reasons
For the phone calls and smiles
And it hurts
And I'm lonely
And I should never have tried
And I missed you tonight
It must be time to leave

A circle of angels deep in war

Deep as I am, I'm no one's fool
Weak as I am
So what am I now? I'm love's last hope
I'm all of the soft words I once owned
If I opened my heart, there'd be no space for air
'Cause I wanted you
Weak as I am, no tears for you
Weak as I am, no tears for you
Deep as I am, I'm no one's fool
Weak as I am

In this weak young heart
Am I too much for you?

Colour what we've lost

These shattered ties with no compromise
Fall through this fragile hell
You see the drinks stay sipped
'Cos we've lost our grip
Too exhausted to rebel

Let your blood flow freely, so all your voice can choke

They made him up then wrote a book to keep you on your kness
They get their theories from the same place
Then build a church if there's some money left

Come on
Don't burst them seams
There's nothing wrong with living the dream
'Cause you just have to know
The sweetest thing is you, baby
The sweetest thing that I can breathe
It's you, baby

But this ain't sifting down from above
I kiss your face
My sanity will manage your ways
I'm strong, I'm free
My confidence is burning the fear
'Cause you just have to know
The sweetest thing is you, baby
The sweetest thing that I can breathe
It's you, baby

Or ego queens will sharpen their heels

So I stand down
Blood stays wet beneath
This cold crown
All I wanted was
Someone blind
To guide me
Maybe to hide in

With callouses like hide
Resistance detonates inside

You're looking like a shit
You're tied up in your own sweet hell
Of watching your own tricks
You're just a silly Willie
A short arsed little stump
You're high and fake like Auntie Drake
Who's shopping with his mum
All you ever wanted was to be him
Everything you want is in his face
All you ever want is to be in now
But the trouble is, you'll always just be her, always her
Look at you, you problem
You think you're causing grief
But we're not brutes we've just begun
To shove it in your face
And every night it's harder
For you to play your dope
'Cause we're exposing breakfast chums
You haven't got a hope
All you ever wanted was to be him
Everything you want is in his face
All you ever want is to be in now
But the trouble is, you'll always just be her

Nothing seems now undiscovered ????
I believe like I've never done before
That you'll always be, always be, always be one of my friends

In the stillness of remembering what you had
And what you lost and what you had and what you lost

Thunder only happens when it's raining
Players only love you when they're playing
Say women they will come and they will go
When the rain washes you clean, you'll know, you'll know


Now here I go again, I see the crystal visions
I keep my visions to myself
It's only me who wants to wrap around your dreams
And have you any dreams you'd like to sell?
Dreams of loneliness

Like a heartbeat drives you mad
In the stillness of remembering what you had
And what you lost and what you had, oh, what you lost

Thunder only happens when it's raining
Players only love you when they're playing

When the rain washes you clean, you'll know

Take your silver spoon, dig your grave
Heartless challenge
Pick your path and I’ll pray
Wake up in the morning
See your sunrise, loves to go down
Lousy lovers pick their prey
But they never cry out loud, cry out

Well, did she make you cry
Make you break down
Shatter your illusions of love
And is it over now? Do you know how?
Pick up the pieces and go home

Rock on, ancient queen
Follow those who pale in your shadow
Rulers make bad lovers
You better put your kingdom up for sale
Up for sale

Well, did she make you cry
Make you break down
Shatter your illusions of love
Well, is it over now? Do you know how?
Pick up the pieces and go home

Well did she make you cry
Make you break down
Shatter your illusions of love
And now tell me, is it over now?
Do you know how to pick up the pieces
And go home? And go home, and go home

And I did not deal with you, I know
Though the love has always been
So I search to find an answer there
So I can truly win

Living through each empty night

When something flies by their window
It might be out on that lawn

Because there's no explaining what your imagination
Can make you see and feel

Seems like a dream
They got me hypnotized

Now it's not a meaningless question
To ask if they've been and gone
I remember a talk about North
Carolina and a strange, strange pond
You see the sides were like glass
In the thick of a forest without a road
And if any man's ever made that land
Then I think it would've showed


They say there's a place down in Mexico
Where a man can fly over mountains and hills
And he don't need an airplane or some kind of engine
And he never will
Now you know it's a meaningless question
To ask if those stories are right
Because what matters most if the feeling

You get when you're hypnotized

Wait for the dark of night

Ever poison their own well

When you thought you'd had your fill
Take all the time you will
This is not a test, it's not a drill
Take no prisoners, break their will

He wants me with him now
Because she just seems to be missing
How could that happen anyhow?
So how can you say
Well I don't know what love is?
You haven't and you have no time for it
You feel completely different
You feel pushed up against the wall
And then one day it just almost goes away
You spend lots of time alone and
Sometimes you spend years
And you miss those arms that used to go around you
Night after night
No questions asked and
Who cares, the cold wind of it all, every time
Well it's hard to be civil
And it's real hard to be nice
But you did it my love every time
So how can you say well I can't see you
Not now, not tomorrow, not until it's right
Not until
None of us is pushed up against the wall
I don't know, the wind doesn't get you anymore
So today she says, ""Well I've changed my mind""

Track a ghost through the fog

And though you're in my heart
We're still a world apart
As now I'm back to the time
Where I would search for a dream
But no use to try anymore as before
Someday I'll die, and maybe then I'll be with you
So I'm closing my eyes
To hear the people laug
For they're all aglow
Not knowing where to go
But is it asking too much
When the question is what to do
With the life I'll have
It seems I know nothing now
Except my love for you
And the strength in my hands
To go on feeding your smile",1969-09-19,https://genius.com/Fleetwood-mac-closing-my-eyes-lyrics

That I've got plenty of

And how many times
Must I be the fool
Before I can make it

Is there nobody listening to my song?

You talk about a life
Been searching for the key
But can't find an answer
To comfort me
I ask myself about love
Can't even find the door
To take me to a place
I've never seen before

The last generation
But that's all right
She's on her way
She had the Midas touch
She was Lady Luck
She's got a million bucks
And she looks like it
She's had a few hard times
Sometimes it blows her mind
Those papers she never signed
Sometimes she remembers

Sometimes she was just an actress
But you'll never really know
A shadow moves across her face
You cannot see her soul
Unless she lets you
See her soul

She was a girlie girl
Caught in a man's world
And as her world turns
She feels so alone
Still she's a danger girl
Insane far beyond her years
On some things she's very clear
She's a wild adventurer

You cannot see her soul unless she lets you

See her soul, if she lets you

Maybe our paths are not supposed to cross twice
Maybe your arms are not supposed to go around me
I hear about you now and then
I wonder where you are and how you feel
Sometimes I walk by and I look up to your balcony
Just to make sure that you were real
Just to make sure that I can still feel you

When I see you again
As I always do
It appears to me that
Destiny rules
And the spirits are ruthless with the paths they choose
It's not being together
It's just following the rules
No one's a fool

Six weeks in a foreign country, how the time flew
I didn't speak the language, but somehow I knew
That that would be the only time that we could be alone and foolish
We said we'd never come home


I like the coastal cities, I like the lights
I like the way the city blends into the ocean at night
It's like living on a working river; the coastline is glittering
Like a diamond snake in a black sky

For every good thing, must you get bad
But I won't worry, and if I'm living on borrowed time
I'm gonna keep on the way I'm going
Keep on the way I'm going
For every crime, there's retribution
And every valley has a mountainside
No, I don't like to trade just to be happy
That kind of deal won't turn out right

See it is no good to stare inside yourself too long
For every true thing there's one more lie

The end of the light
She keeps the remains of all of her foes
Miranda is dying with all of her might
She never comes
She always goes
She sticks the camera right into her arm
Anything to forget what the trouble's about
It causes her pain
That's part of the charm
She's down for the count then finally out

Miranda is taking the stars down
A little something to call her own
But the lion still rules Miranda
And Miranda is always alone

She sees her face in another magazine
And the walls all close in as the fancy takes flight
Can't stand to be loved
But she loves to be seen
She slips down headlong into the night


And then all at once the sun starts to rise
She sees her father holding her down
All the daylight is poison to her eyes
She slips down the shade and lets herself drown


The lights shine down the marina
All across her safety zone
But loneliness follows Miranda
And Miranda is always alone

It might be some crazy people talking
Or somebody that we ought to know

You see strange shapes in moonlight
And shadows in the night
They said that wingtip seemed to brush their faces
And strangers stole their sight
Way down in the triangle
Where the sea was smooth as glass
Giving you one answer to a question
That you never thought you'd ask
Ah down in Bermuda, in the pale blue sea
Way down in Bermuda, yeah it's easy to believe
Down in the triangle, it's easy to believe

They came from Galveston
They came from New Orleans
And then from Bloomington, and Delaware
The used St. Petersburg, they came from Tampa
And then from Mexico, it doesn't matter where
They all completely share
All of those ships and planes
A great big mystery that cannot be explained
Down in Bermuda, in the pale blue sea

Your feeling safe in your harbour
And everything seems certain
Right next to Palm Beach and Key Biscane
Behind a velvet curtain
But then the moon goes grey with worry
And the sea turns a pale white
You better believe something strange is going on tonight
Down in Bermuda, ah, the pale blue sea

I can come right out mean just what I say

And the roses that are offing
They are real as evening wind
They are washed by love and suffering
Cause my love has colored them
Colored them
Oooooh oooohh-nothing but roses
Don't dam the river that's running through you
Stop saving up for time that may never become
I've seen the future come true in twenty days
But don't let is scare you, stop thinking about yesterday
I've had my share of blue revelations
And I know that time is a region to be passed
So all through the dust and green magnesium fire
I can rest easy now, and watch the carnival rolling by
Cause a rose that will be growing
In the place where I have hidden
It is washed by love and suffering
That my love has colored in

Look where the roses lie aaahhh
Look where the roses grow

Most every night

And I see your face
Your eyes tell me you still care
But it's suddenly over
With morning's first light
 
As the day begins
This feeling is going strong
Sometimes the only thing
That keeps me going on
And until you find
Your own way back to me
I'll be forever

So very much
You know it just brings you down
It's just something you can touch
You don't belong here
I guess you never did
Whisper, look up, in your ear
You just keep it so well hid

Anyone at all
Could see what was missing
Could see you were dying
But no one was crying

And I did hear what you said
Now I can go home
All my days are blue
All my days are bright

We come, we come, we come, we come
To take you over (ah)

You say you want your freedom

Of your loneliness
Like a heartbeat, drives you mad
In the stillness of remembering what you had
And what you lost
And what you had

Oh, thunder only happens when it's raining
Players only love you when they're playing
They say women, they will come and they will go
When the rain washes you clean, you'll know
You'll know
Now here I go again
I see the crystal vision
I keep my visions to myself
It's only me who wants to
Wrap around your dreams and
Have you any dreams you'd like to sell?
Dreams of loneliness
Like a heartbeat, drives you mad
In the stillness of remembering what you had
And what you lost
And what you had
Ooh, what you lost

Players only love you when they're playing

Why people lie, and break a heart in two

Things go the way they do

Time is all I need to make me heal
You're gone
And now I'm all alone (now you're all alone)

I won't live in a world of illusion

Tonight we'll pray for water
Cool water
Way up there
You hear a prayer
And show us where there's water
Cool clear water
Keep moving Dan
Don't you listen to him Dan
He's a devil not a man
And he spreads the burning sand with water
Dan don't you see that big green tree
Where the water's runnin' free
And it's waiting there for me and you
All day I face the baron ways
Without the taste of water
Cool clear water

248,Fleetwood Mac,Silver Heels,Heroes Are Hard to Find,"She came in like a hurricane
Wearing boots and diamond rings
With a fox fur on her shoulder
She set wondering
And I could tell she was feeling abandoned
Because she flashed a look across my way
She said, ""Hop for a ride
You'll never ask me but I'll tell you anyway""

She took me out on the blackboard jungle
Put me straight in a hurricane
She hypnotized my eyes with her silver heeled ways
If I could sing like Paul McCartney and get funky like Etta James
I'd never change, I'd never change
I'd never change silver heeled ways

She came in and her flags were flying
She was a sailboat of sweet perfume
And I could see that her eyes were smiling
From across the room
Well I couldn't think of conversation
I was busy looking at her furs
She said, ""Hey, you'll never ask me
So I guess I'll say the word""

A gorgeous opal crown sat on his head
Although the garden is a lovely place

And now we're passing on the reins
Because in my heart I can feel the change
You know the lord of light is laughing
Because things don't stay the same

He controlled the brimstone, and eternal fire
Surrounds himself with downers, in the king of cold
You know that he had all the princes kissing his diamond ring
And I heard that he walled up, the door to summer
And cut the heart out of mister spring


Dream on, keep your eyes wide open...
On a Sunday morning, with a voice that's cold
The future gives a warning of the fire that burns below
He puts his hands together, cause his faith is strong

Stand on the rock

Oh, you play so rough (so rough)
But my love's too tough
Might as well give it up

Without ideals or violence
She doesn't have to say she's faithful
But she's true, like ice, like fire
People carry roses
Make promises by the hours
My love laughs like the flowers
Valentines can't buy her
In the dime stores and bus stations
People talk of situations
Read books, repeat quotations
Draw conclusions on the wall
Some speak of the future
My love, she speaks softly
She knows there's no success like failure
And that failure's no success at all
The cloak and dagger dangles
Madams light the candles
In ceremonies of the horsemen
Even the pawn must hold a grudge
Statues made of matchsticks
Crumble into one another
My love winks, she does not bother
She knows too much to argue or to judge
The bridge at midnight trembles
The country doctor rambles
Bankers' nieces seek perfection
Expecting all the gifts that wise men bring
The wind howls like a hammer
The night goes rainy
My love, she's like some raven
At my window with a broken wing
My love, she speaks like silence

And she tries hard to tell this story... but it's a hard one to tell
She consults her book of Miracles...
Cry... and the wind says fly on
Well now you're on your own
You're back out on the road again for a million reasons
Well you're back out on the road again
And you try to tie together some connections...
You get some ribbons and some bows and get back out on the road again
So you found a queen without a king
Oh yes, and everyone here loved her... no one was wrong
But you're a little bit like her
You're just a little bit like her
A little bit like her... a little bit like Juliet
Turn to the blue crystal mirror... well as always it is truthful
Oh, well you see it in the reflection of the real blue lamp
Well tie the connection... get some ribbons and some bows... get back
Out on the road
But when they were good... they were really good... really good stranger
So you found a queen without a king
Oh yes, and everyone here loved her... no one was wrong
You're a little bit like her
You're just a little bit like her
A little bit like her... a little bit like Juliet
Let the crisis become a bridge... and cross that bridge tomorrow
Well let the time that goes between, baby...
Well let it let go of the sorrow

But she was young and dumb
She'd just turned 21
She didn't care to hang around
So when the shit came down
Why she was nowhere to be found
This life can turn a good girl bad
She was the sweetest thing
That you had ever seen

You're such a delicate boy
In the hysterical realm
Of an emotional landslide
In physical terms

With your cherry lips and golden curls
You could make grown men gasp
When you go walking past them
In your hot pants and high heels
They could not believe
That such a body was for real
It seemed like rainbows would appear
Whenever you came near
The clouds would disappear
Because you looked just like a girl
Your baby blues would flash
And suddenly a spell was cast

You're such a delicate boy
In the hysterical realm
Of an emotional landslide
In physical terms

You hold a candle in your heart
You shine the light on hidden parts

You can't sit still and you don't like hanging around the crowd

You dropped by here as I was sleeping
You came to see the whole commotion
And when I woke I started laughing
The joke's on me for not believing

You'd better cough it up
Beautiful like shards of glass
In your throat they'll cut you up

That was such a spiteful thing to do
You smile as the words spew out your mouth
So I laugh in your face right back at you

There's no reward for men who weep
No medals given out
But better be the one who speaks
Than be the man who won't

Hauling rock over Buddha with the Longhorn
Got a hole, rip a pocket off my uniform
With the Blackwatch Boys get your heads down
Duty calls but it is way too late I'm too far gone
Waiting for Godot, hell with my pants down
Cracked the stash sent me crying in the midday sun
I miss my dog and I miss my freedom

I don't know why they are calling on the radio
They know I'm here just out of sight
I don't know why they're calling on the radio
He's by my side and I know I'm right

I hate the things I think about you when I'm all alone
I know you're tough but I've been gone for so long
I play the memories of you inside my head
So all those pictures of us burn and radiate
Watch the clouds and I'm falling, falling through the cracks
Head beats and the heart is pounding fast
Off the ground into the starry dark
Into your arms I'm falling
I'm falling, I'm falling

I don't know why they are calling on the radio
They know I'm here just out of sight
I don't know why they're calling on the radio
He's by my side and I know I'm right

My brain, my body's fried
I've got to stay alive
I've got to take a chance and keep on moving
Keep on moving

I don't know why they are calling on the radio
They know I'm here just out of sight
Don't know why they're calling on the radio
He's by my side and I know I'm right
Don't know why they are calling on the radio
It's on my side and I know I'm right
I don't know why they are calling on the radio

Nothing that you pray would forgive you
Nothing's what your words mean to me
Something that you did will destroy me
Something that you said will stay with me

My skin would fall
From off my bones
And run away from here

As heaven is wide
As far from God
As angels can fly

If holy is as holy does
This house will burn straight down to hell
And take its conscience with it as it falls

My trust was blind, you broke the pact
If God's my witness, God must be blind

If flesh could crawl

What's inside a man that goes so wrong?
Choke on guilt, that's far too good for you
Say one word, I'll laugh and bury you
And leave you in the place where you left me

And pray that you might give me a call

Just staring at the walls
Hanging round bars at night
Wishing I had never been born
And give myself to anyone
Who wants to take me home

My belly somersaults
When I pick them off the floor

I'm looking far too skinny
I've stopped returning all their calls

Our candy jars and our sticky hands

52,Garbage,Destroying Angels,Destroying Angels - Single,"The day was nearly over
They were hosing down the house
They caught sight of her poor body
In the rushes and the mud
She lay where she had fallen
They had hunted high and low
But winter had come early
And she had been covered up by snow

It took an hour to cut her
From the spot where she was found
A bright red velvet ribbon
Was tangled in her gown
Her skin was icy white
Her veins were thin and blue
There was black ink on her fingers
And blood on her toes and her shoes

Bees made honey upon her lips
Lips I've waited so long to kiss
She seemed so pure without a doubt
'Til the last red drop leaked out

Destroying angels
I knew you so well
Destroying angels
No lies will you tell
No lies will you tell

Some things they are so painful
No words for them exist
And everyone was solemn
As they laid her in the dirt
I stood trembling by her graveside
With everybody else
My sins and all my secrets burn
Like fat inside my chest

I could tell you that I loved you more
Than I ever loved myself
I could swear I'd never harm a hair
Upon her lovely head
But I stole her savage beauty
She will never lie again
I stuffed her full of death caps
And it killed my angel dead

Bees made honey upon her lips
Lips I've waited so long to kiss
She seemed so pure without a doubt
'Til the last red drop leaked out

Destroying angels
I knew you so well
Destroying angels
No lies will you tell
No lies will you tell

I've reached the end of the road
I just don't care anymore
Won't cry these tears anymore

There's no way she can kiss you
The way that I do
I heard that you miss me
Oh you should be careful of who you keep talking to
Long nights without you
Have taught me to be strong
I've cut all my losses
Think no more about it cause I couldn't find it in you

I just don't care anymore
I've reached the end of the road
I just don't care anymore
Won't cry these tears anymore

There was a time I thought I'd die
If you should ever leave me high and dry
And you don't want me any more
It's time to settle the score

I just don't care anymore
I've reached the end of my tether I've torn all your letters up
I just don't care anymore
Won't cry these tears anymore
I just don't care anymore

What a mess, a train wreck of lipstick
What a joke, but do you hear me laughing?
Get out my face before I lose my patience
Now me and you, let's cut this party
Oh little boy, it takes a lot to shake me
So shake it

It's the battle in me

To the past and the future
And let's make out

See how it feels with a passion burning
We'll be damned when we're done

Shake it, shake it
Shake it off
Shake it, shake it
Shake it off
Shake it, shake it
Shake it off
Shake it, shake it off

In my lover's arms, I wait for morning
I beg my god to speak and tear me apart
I'd lay down my body
I'd lay down my arms
I never once in my sweet, short life meant anybody harm

In my happy home, I read the signs
In my lover's arms, I move in time

And there's no more lies
I never once in my sweet, short life was waiting for desire

The force you struck me down caught me by surprise
You sprung the mojo and it worked like a charm
I felt invincible with you in my arms

I must confess it can be good to feel pain
Like breaking waves or getting caught in the rain
Playing those games cause we had nothing to do
I was oblivious, I was losing to you

I will love you till the day that I die
I will love you till the day that I die
I will love you till the day that I die
I will love you till the day that I die

Holy Jesus, holy rock 'n roll
The more I gave to you, the more you grew bored
And making love became the waging of war
No peace, no tenderness, no fun anymore

I will love you till the day that I die
I will love you till the day that I die
I will love you till the day that I die
I will love you till the day that I die
I will love you till the day that I die

You turned your face to me and started to say
Something so beautiful, it hurt deep inside

'cause we know how you are
We never thought
Your quitting was good
We thought that we knew you
Well, I guess that we don't
Are you heavenly or
Just like the past?
We called you ""the black penny""
Remember that?

The sea is wide
The streets are long
And there's blood on all our hands
With the catalyst gone
And only what's left to us
Is history built on dust
I was sweating on poet's words
Great nations and governments
Feat lies in victories
Eager and keen to please
Those good keys are everywhere
With their thousand-yard stare
We all end up the same
Like little lambs to meet their end",2002-09-22,https://genius.com/Garbage-april-tenth-lyrics

Where the boys are and everybody's high

If enough is never enough and you're down at heart
If the world is bringing you down then come with us
If enough is never enough and you're down at heart
If the world is getting you down then come with us

Back to the bar where the place is slamming
All the pretty queens and the sluts are dancin'
And the conscience of politicians sly
All sweat and lust and filthy habits
All the wannabes are going to sell their package
At the carnival of lonely broken hearts

If enough is never enough and you're down at heart
If the world is bringing you down then come with us
If enough is never enough and you're down at heart
If the world is getting you down then come with us

If enough is never enough and you're down at heart

Darling, I don't need money
I could be happy with someone to love

I've been a fool
On a wild ride to oblivion
I lost my mind
But with you, it's understood
You make me feel strong
Your arms look so powerful
When they hold me down

Darling, I don't need money
I could be happy with someone to love

Everyone looks dangerous
And no one keeps their promises
And I am always running
And you have your dark places
Regretting, feeling
Remembering something
We never said (regretting)
We wish we said (something)
We should have said (regretting)
We could have said (something)

Or strangers to love me, no diamonds and pearls
Or fast cars designed for the rock stars

Where the good guy always wins

Until you figure out
A way that you can live without
Stories with happy ends
Everyone I know is trying to get by
Fighting all the half-true lies
Nobody can win
They fill you up with expectations
Innovations and predictions that can't
Possibly fly
Cinderella's waiting tables
And the princess never did wake up
That's how it begins

With the universe above
Try to find a line, connect
With a world that make no sense. I’ve a feeling

Busy river flow and wind

Always ask the lake – you’ll get all the answers

To be consumed by you again
Think you're cured
You'd see it come
The folly of
A monster love
Like you

Grey is good
The light is good
We went down to Hollywood
You only get one chance in Tinsel Town

I save the part
The sweetest part
Shook for you

Everything comes around
Bringing us back again
Here is where we start
And where we end

I never thought I would return
To be consumed by you again
But I know a paper moon
The folly of a monster love like you

The pavement smell
Just after rain
The sun leaps out, it's clear again
I told you how I felt the earth could move

The folly of
A monster love
Like you

Everything comes around
Bringing us back again
Here is where we start
And where we end

Everything comes around
Bringing us back again
Here is where we start
And where we end

Everything comes around

89,Goldfrapp,Ride a White Horse (Ewan Pearson Disco Odyssey Part 1),We Are Glitter,"Now take me dancing at the disco
Where you buy your Winniebago
I wanna ride on a white horse
I want to ride on a white horse

When the light turns into darkness
Will he turn up to explain us?
I wanna ride on a white horse
I want to ride on a white horse

Lend me a whole new world
All night, feel life, oh, oh!
When is there ever sense
To love this world? Oh, oh!

In the whirlpool, we'll go deeper
In this world that's getting cheaper
I wanna ride on a white horse
I want to ride on a white horse

I like dancing at the disco
I want blisters, you're my leader
I wanna ride on a white horse
I want to ride on a white horse

Lend me a whole new world
All night, feel life, oh, oh!
When is there ever sense
To love this world? Oh, oh!


Lend me a whole new world
All night, feel life, oh, oh!
When is there ever sense
To love this world? Oh, oh!

Oh, I love this feeling
Feels like forever
Oh, I love this feeling
Feels like real leather


Oh, I love this feeling
Feels like forever
Oh, I love this feeling
Feels like real leather
Oh, I love this feeling
Feels like forever
Oh, I love this feeling
Feels like real leather",,https://genius.com/Goldfrapp-ride-a-white-horse-ewan-pearson-disco-odyssey-part-1-lyrics

91,Goldfrapp,You Never Know (Múm Mix),We Are Glitter,"I love you
Steel painted eyes
Feels like snow
Change my head
Days so long

You never know, you never know, you never know
You never know, you never know, you never know
Just how long it will be

Today I know
It's too long dare we'll see
Feels like snow
Chained myself to me

You never know, you never know, you never know
You never know, you never know, you never know
Just how long it will be

Here we go again
We're going round and round
Here we go again
We're going round and round

We're going round and round",2006-05-01,https://genius.com/Goldfrapp-you-never-know-mum-mix-lyrics
92,Goldfrapp,Eat yourself (corrected),---,"If you don't eat yourself,
No doubt the blade is deep
You could longer life
Seen it on that land

You went south on the train,
she wore plastic boots for rain
And you're cruel: another thin line
You're dreading this, caught lonely.

Who will I be when I'm with you again?
Silver jet in the sky
You are the pain
Got a song, got to sing
For life

If you don't eat yourself
No doubt the blade is deep
If you don't eat yourself
You will explode instead

Cause I love love you so
When I know you don't love me
You wore the lies
til their worn get wicked, get it done

Who will I be when I'm with you again?
Silver jet in the sky
You are the pain
Got a song, got to sing
For life
