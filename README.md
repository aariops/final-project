## Description

I developed "Girl Talk" as my final project for the Data Analysis bootcamp at Ironhack Lisbon, during a dystopian week of social isolation in March 2020. _Feedback is very welcome!_

I used Genius' API to gather about 30k lyrics of songs by women and used NLP to do topic modelling.

You can read about the results on [this website](https://aariops.github.io/).
